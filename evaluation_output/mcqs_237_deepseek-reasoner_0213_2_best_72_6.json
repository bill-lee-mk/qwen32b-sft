      "D": "Put the first note in 'Book Source' and the second note in 'Personal Experience.'"
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because the first note recalls information from a personal experience, so it belongs in 'Personal Experience,' and the second note gathers information from a book source, so it belongs in 'Book Source.'
