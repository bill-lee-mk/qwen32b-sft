Difficulty: Labeled “hard”; no explicit difficulty definitions in context, so applied general bar for Grade 3 RL.3.7—multi-source inference about mood vs. literal details; item requires synthesis and evaluation of best explanation → appropriate for hard within grade band.\nStep 4 – Overall: C=0, N=0 → 0.85–1.0.

Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nMetric notes:\n- Factual accuracy: Both source facts are correct; key aligns with reality; D is a plausible but unsupported-by-sources distractor, not a factual error in the item.\n- Educational accuracy: Assesses combining info from two sources; no giveaways; fits W.3.7 intent.\n- Curriculum alignment: Directly targets W.3.7 by integrating information from multiple sources.\n- Clarity & precision: Task and options unambiguous.\n- Spec compliance: No explicit hard spec provided; treat as compliant.\n- Reveals misconceptions: A and B reflect using only one source; D reflects outside knowledge not tied to provided sources—good diagnostic value.\n- Difficulty alignment: No difficulty definitions provided; applied general bar. For Grade 3, integrating two brief sources to choose a synthesis statement is appropriate (DoK ~2, medium). Label “hard” is acceptable within typical variance; not ≥2-grade mismatch.\n- Passage reference: Proper reference and use of provided sources.\n- Distractor quality: Plausible and parallel; single-source vs both-source distinction is clear.\n- Stimulus quality: Helpful, accurate source snippets; no harm.\n- Mastery learning: Requires synthesis/integration, not pure recall.\n- Localization: Neutral, age-appropriate.\n\nC=0 (no critical failures), N=0 (no non-critical failures).
