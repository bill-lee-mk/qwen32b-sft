    "question": "Read the passage about monarch butterflies.\n\nMonarch butterflies undertake one of the most remarkable migrations in the animal kingdom. Each fall, millions of monarchs travel from North America to central Mexico, covering distances up to 3,000 miles. They use environmental cues, such as decreasing daylight and cooler temperatures, to trigger their journey. Upon arrival, they cluster in oyamel fir trees, where they remain dormant through the winter. In spring, the same butterflies begin the return trip north, laying eggs along the way. This cyclical migration is crucial for their survival, as it allows them to avoid harsh winters and exploit seasonal resources. However, habitat loss and climate change are threatening this ancient phenomenon.\n\nWhich choice best states the central idea of the passage?",
