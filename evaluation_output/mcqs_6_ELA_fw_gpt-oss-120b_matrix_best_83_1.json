The journey north begins, but no single butterfly makes it all the way. One generation travels a few hundred miles, lays eggs, and dies; its offspring continue the trek. It takes three or four generations for the monarchs to reach the forests of southern Canada, where they feast on wildflowers before the next wave of generations repeats the pattern.\n\nWhen fall arrives, a special generation of monarchs sets out on a different path. These butterflies fly thousands of miles southward, navigating by the sun and the Earth’s magnetic field, to the high-altitude oyamel fir forests of central Mexico. There, they cluster on tree branches in massive, shimmering colonies that can number in the millions. The cool, moist microclimate of these forests protects the butterflies during the winter months.\n\nScientists track this remarkable migration to learn how climate change and habitat loss affect the butterflies.

As the ice retreats earlier in the spring and forms later in the fall, polar bears are forced to spend more time on land, where they have less access to their primary prey—seal blubber. Researchers have documented longer fasting periods, reduced body condition, and lower cub survival rates. While some bears have adapted by foraging for bird eggs and vegetation, these alternative foods provide far fewer calories. The decline in sea‑ice is linked to rising global temperatures caused by increased greenhouse‑gas emissions from human activities. If current trends continue, scientists project that polar bear populations could decline by as much as 30 percent by 2050.\n\nBased on the passage, which choice best summarizes the central idea without adding personal opinions or judgments?",

He tossed his line impatiently, pulling it in after each splash, but only snagged weeds.\n\nGrandfather told him, \"Good things take time. Let the water be still and watch.\" Jamie learned to sit quietly, feeling the tug only after the sun warmed the lake. He practiced casting slowly, waiting for the right moment.\n\nAfter many hours of patient waiting, Jamie finally felt a strong pull. He reeled in a shining trout, and his grandfather smiled. Jamie realized that the calm and steady effort had brought the reward.\n\nWhich choice best states the central idea of the passage and shows how the author develops it through specific details?",
