It is easily recognized by its large, black patches around its eyes, over its ears, and across its round body. Unlike most bears, pandas do not hibernate. They spend up to 14 hours a day eating, mostly bamboo. Pandas have a special wrist bone that acts like a thumb to help them grip bamboo stalks. Because they eat so much bamboo, pandas play a crucial role in spreading bamboo seeds in the forests where they live. However, their habitat is shrinking, making them a vulnerable species.\n\nWhich choice best expresses the main idea of the passage?",

Maya whispered to me, 'I wish we could eat them right now!' I thought about how much work gardening required and felt tired just looking at the plants. The narrator explained that harvesting marked the end of a long growing season.\"\n\nA student named Leo says, \"Gardening is boring because you have to wait too long to see results.\" \n\nWhich option BEST explains how Leo's point of view differs from those in the passage?",

      "A": "Leo agrees with Maya that the tomatoes look delicious and should be eaten immediately.",

      "D": "Leo feels exactly the same as the character 'I' who is tired from all the gardening work."

Mr. Chen is proud, Maya is eager to eat the tomatoes, the character 'I' feels tired but acknowledges the work, and the narrator neutrally describes the harvest as ending a growing season.

      "A": "Honeybees are insects. They live in hives. They have six legs. They make honey. Some people keep bees as pets.",
      "B": "Bees are very important. I think bees are cool. My uncle has a beehive. Last summer, I got to see the bees up close. It was fun.",
      "C": "Honeybees play a crucial role in helping plants grow through pollination. This report will explain their pollination process, describe the types of plants they help, and show how this benefits our food supply.",
      "D": "Pollination is when pollen moves. Bees help with this. They fly from flower to flower. The pollen sticks to them. Then new seeds can grow."
    },

      "A": "Without bees, our world would be very different. Many people are afraid of bees because they can sting.",
      "B": "Bees live in hives and have a queen. They work together to make honey, which is a sweet food.",
      "C": "For example, bees pollinate over 130 types of fruits and vegetables, including apples and almonds. This means one out of every three bites of food we take depends on bee pollination.",
      "D": "Some bees are black and yellow. They fly from flower to flower collecting nectar to bring back to their hive."

      "D": "Studies show that increased physical activity correlates with improved academic performance and social development."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because it is appropriate for the task (a formal letter), the purpose (to persuade), and the audience (the school principal). It uses respectful and formal language, clearly states the request, and provides a reason focused on student benefit, which aligns with a principal's concerns. The other options are either too informal, lack persuasive reasoning suited to the audience, or use language too complex for a third-grade student to naturally produce.",
