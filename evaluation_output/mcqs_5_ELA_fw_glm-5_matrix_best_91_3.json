Scientists have discovered that rising ocean temperatures are causing coral bleaching, a process that turns vibrant coral white and weak. In 2016 alone, nearly half of the reef's coral died due to unusually warm waters. Marine biologists are now working on solutions, including breeding heat-resistant coral and reducing pollution from nearby farms. While these efforts offer hope, researchers warn that without addressing the root cause of climate change, the reef's future remains uncertain.\n\nBased on the passage, which statement best explains why the author mentions both the solutions scientists are developing AND the warning about climate change?",

Each year, millions of monarchs travel up to 3,000 miles from Canada and the United States to central Mexico. This journey takes several months to complete. What makes this migration even more remarkable is that no single butterfly completes the entire round trip. The butterflies that start the journey are not the same ones that return. Instead, it takes three to four generations of monarchs to complete one full migration cycle. The butterflies that fly north in the spring lay eggs along the way. Their offspring continue the journey, and this pattern repeats until the monarchs reach their northern homes. Scientists are still studying how these tiny insects know where to go, since they have never made the journey before.\n\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the passage?",

    "question": "Read the passage and answer the question.\n\nThe Critical Role of Pollinators\n\nBees are among the most important pollinators on Earth. When a bee lands on a flower to collect nectar, tiny grains of pollen stick to its fuzzy body. As the bee moves from flower to flower, some of this pollen rubs off onto the sticky stigma of other flowers. This process, called pollination, allows plants to produce seeds and fruits. Scientists estimate that bees help pollinate about one-third of the food people eat, including apples, almonds, and blueberries.\n\nHowever, bee populations have been declining in recent years. Scientists believe several factors contribute to this decline. Pesticides used in farming can harm bees' nervous systems, making it difficult for them to navigate back to their hives. Habitat loss also affects bees, as wildflower meadows are converted into cities and farmland. Additionally, climate change has caused some flowers to bloom earlier in the spring, before bees have emerged from their winter rest.\n\nTo help protect bees, some farmers are planting wildflower strips along the edges of their fields. These strips provide bees with additional food sources and shelter. Gardeners can also help by planting native flowers that bloom at different times throughout the growing season. These efforts demonstrate how human actions can either harm or help the natural systems that support both wildlife and human food production.\n\nWhich choice best expresses the main idea of the passage?",

    "question": "Read the passage below and answer the question.\n\nThe Science of Weather Forecasting\n\nWeather forecasting has changed dramatically over the past century. In the early 1900s, meteorologists relied mainly on observations from the ground. They looked at cloud formations, measured wind speed, and recorded temperatures. However, these methods had significant limitations because they could only show what was happening in one location at one time.\n\nToday, meteorologists use sophisticated technology to predict weather patterns. Weather satellites orbiting Earth capture images of cloud movements from space. Doppler radar systems track precipitation and can even detect rotation within storms, helping to warn people about possible tornadoes. Weather balloons equipped with instruments measure temperature, humidity, and air pressure at different heights in the atmosphere.\n\nPerhaps the most important advancement is the use of computer models. Supercomputers process billions of pieces of data from around the world to create detailed forecasts. These models can predict weather conditions up to two weeks in advance with increasing accuracy. Despite these advances, weather forecasting remains challenging because the atmosphere is incredibly complex. Small changes in one area can lead to unexpected results elsewhere—a phenomenon scientists call the 'butterfly effect.'\n\nWhich choice best describes the main idea of the passage?",

As bees fly from flower to flower collecting nectar, they transfer pollen between plants. This process, called pollination, helps plants grow and produce food. In fact, bees help pollinate many of the fruits and vegetables we eat, including apples, blueberries, and cucumbers.\n\nSecond, honeybees live and work together in a highly organized colony. Each bee has a specific job. The queen bee lays eggs, while worker bees build the hive, collect nectar, and protect their home. Drones, which are male bees, help produce new bees.

    "question": "Read the passage below and answer the question.\n\nHoneybees: Tiny Heroes in Danger\n\nHoneybees may be small, but their impact on our world is enormous. These industrious insects are responsible for pollinating about one-third of all the food we eat. From apples and almonds to blueberries and cucumbers, many fruits and vegetables depend on bees to transfer pollen between flowers. Without this pollination process, these crops would not grow properly, leading to food shortages and higher prices. Farmers around the world rely on bees to help produce billions of dollars worth of crops each year.\n\nDespite their importance, honeybees face serious threats to their survival. In recent years, beekeepers have reported losing large numbers of their hives. Scientists have identified several causes for this decline. Pesticides used in farming can harm bees' nervous systems and affect their ability to navigate back to their hives. Habitat loss from urban development reduces the wildflowers bees need for food. Additionally, parasites and diseases have spread through bee populations, weakening entire colonies. Climate change is also disrupting the timing of flower blooming, which means bees may emerge before or after the plants they depend on are available.\n\nConservation efforts are underway to protect these vital pollinators. Some farmers are planting wildflower strips near their crops to provide bees with additional food sources. Researchers are developing safer alternatives to harmful pesticides. Individuals can help too, by planting bee-friendly gardens and avoiding chemical lawn treatments. By working together, we can help ensure that honeybees continue their essential work for generations to come.\n\nWhich choice best identifies the two main ideas of the article?",

Orville and Wilbur Wright approached this challenge differently from their rivals. While other inventors like Samuel Langley focused on building powerful engines, the Wright brothers concentrated on developing a reliable method for steering and controlling an aircraft. They studied how birds adjusted their wings during flight and built a wind tunnel to test wing shapes. This research led them to design a system of wires that allowed pilots to twist the wings, enabling the aircraft to turn and maintain balance.\n\nSamuel Langley, supported by the U.S. government, attempted to fly his steam-powered Aerodrome in October 1903. Both attempts ended in failure when the aircraft crashed into the Potomac River. Just nine days after Langley's second failure, the Wright brothers achieved success at Kitty Hawk on December 17, 1903. Their careful testing and focus on control, rather than raw power, proved to be the key difference. Langley had spent nearly $50,000 on his project, while the Wright brothers spent less than $1,000. Despite Langley's greater resources and government backing, the Wright brothers' methodical approach to solving the problem of control ultimately led to their success.\n\nBased on the passage, which choice best explains the relationship between the different approaches of Langley and the Wright brothers and their different outcomes?",

    "question": "Read the two passages about honeybees.\n\nPassage 1: Honeybees are remarkable foragers that travel up to five miles from their hive in search of food. Their primary goal is collecting nectar, a sugary liquid produced by flowers. As bees crawl into flowers to reach the nectar, pollen grains attach to their fuzzy bodies. Scientists have found that a single bee can carry thousands of pollen grains at once.\n\nPassage 2: Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one flower fertilizes another flower of the same plant species. This process is essential for many fruits and vegetables that humans consume, including apples, almonds, and blueberries. Research shows that crops pollinated by bees produce significantly higher yields than those pollinated by wind alone.\n\nBased on information from BOTH passages, which conclusion is best supported?",

When Maya tries to discuss medication schedules during dinner, Jordan snaps, \"Can't we just have a normal meal without turning everything into a medical meeting?\" Maya responds, \"If we don't stay organized, something important could get missed.\" Though both siblings love their grandmother deeply, their different approaches create tension—Maya believes Jordan is avoiding reality, while Jordan believes Maya is missing what matters most.\n\nBased on specific details in the passage, which choice best explains the central conflict between Maya and Jordan?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Maya prioritizes organization and medical information, while Jordan values emotional connection and normalcy, leading them to misunderstand each other's intentions.",

      "C": "Both siblings agree completely on how to handle their grandmother's illness and support each other without any tension.",
      "D": "Maya distrusts all the doctors and refuses to follow their advice, while Jordan handles every medical decision without consulting anyone."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because the passage provides specific details showing that Maya focuses on research, notebooks, medication schedules, and challenging doctors with questions, while Jordan focuses on reading aloud, reminiscing, and maintaining normalcy during meals. The passage explicitly states that Maya thinks Jordan is 'avoiding reality' and Jordan thinks Maya is 'missing what matters most,' showing they misunderstand each other's intentions despite both caring deeply for their grandmother.",

Each colony has three types of bees: the queen, worker bees, and drones. The queen's job is to lay eggs—she can lay up to 2,000 eggs per day. Worker bees, which are all female, make up about 98% of the colony. They gather nectar and pollen, build honeycomb, and protect the hive. Drones are male bees whose main purpose is to mate with a new queen. Honeybees communicate through special dances that tell other bees where to find food. These dances can indicate both the direction and distance of flowers. Scientists estimate that bees pollinate about 80% of flowering plants, making them essential for growing many foods we eat.'

A 2019 study by Harvard University found that students who ate vegetables and whole grains scored 15% higher on standardized tests than those who did not. Second, healthy lunches help prevent childhood obesity. The CDC reports that 1 in 5 American children are obese, and providing balanced meals at school can reduce this rate significantly. Third, teaching healthy eating habits early leads to lifelong wellness. Research shows that children who eat nutritious school lunches are 40% more likely to make healthy food choices as adults.",
      "B": "Schools should serve healthier lunches. The CDC reports that 1 in 5 American children are obese. A Harvard study showed students who ate vegetables scored higher on tests. Schools should prioritize nutrition because it improves academic performance. Also, balanced meals help prevent obesity. Children who eat nutritious lunches are more likely to make healthy choices later. Teaching healthy habits leads to lifelong wellness. This is why schools need better lunches.",
      "C": "Schools should serve healthier lunches for several important reasons. First, nutritious meals help students do better in school because healthy food gives them energy and helps them focus. Second, healthy lunches can help students maintain a healthy weight, which is important for their overall well-being. Third, when schools provide nutritious options, students learn to make better food choices that will help them throughout their lives. For these reasons, schools should definitely improve their lunch menus.",
      "D": "Schools should serve healthier lunches for three reasons. First, nutritious meals are important because many students eat lunch at school.

Second, additional recess helps students focus better in class. A 2018 study found that students with 30 minutes of recess showed 25% better concentration during afternoon lessons. Third, longer recess gives children more time to develop social skills through play, which helps them cooperate better when they return to class.",
      "B": "First, more recess is fun for students. Kids really enjoy playing outside with their friends during the school day. Second, it gives teachers a break too. Teachers work hard and deserve some quiet time while students are outside. Third, recess is just a good idea because everyone likes having more time for games and activities.",
      "C": "Students should have more recess because it helps them in many different ways. Some kids run around during recess, and others play quietly in groups. Schools have different recess policies across the country. Many students wish they could stay outside longer, but teachers still need to teach lessons. Weather can affect recess schedules, especially in winter when it's too cold.",
      "D": "More recess time would be great for everyone! I really think so because it's important for kids. We should definitely have more of it because it's the right thing to do. Schools should listen to students more often about things like this since students know what they need."

Understanding how volcanoes form, what happens during an eruption, and how scientists study them helps us appreciate these forces of nature.\n\nHow Volcanoes Form\nDeep underground, magma collects in chambers. When pressure builds, magma rises through vents and erupts as lava.\n\nWhat Happens During an Eruption\nDuring an eruption, lava flows down the volcano's sides, ash clouds fill the air, and new rock forms as lava cools.\n\nHow Scientists Study Volcanoes\nScientists monitor ground movement, gas emissions, and temperature changes to predict eruptions and protect nearby communities."

      "D": "They walked for a long time."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option C is correct because it uses concrete sensory details to convey the experience precisely. The word 'crisp' describes how the leaves felt, and 'crunched' describes the sound they made, allowing the reader to see, feel, and hear the experience. Options A, B, and D are vague and general, lacking the specific sensory language that makes an experience come alive for the reader.",

      "D": "The garden looked beautiful with its many plants and trees in the afternoon light."

Slowly, Buster improved. On competition day, Elena was nervous, but Buster seemed to sense it and stayed focused. They completed the course without any mistakes, finishing in record time.

Jordan had watered the plants daily, but they continued to struggle because the root cause remained unfixed.\n\nWhich choice best explains how Maya and Jordan differ in their approach to solving the garden problem?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Maya plans and collaborates with others to find the root cause, while Jordan acts quickly without investigating.",
      "B": "Maya prefers working alone, while Jordan likes to work in groups.",
      "C": "Maya cares more about the garden than Jordan does.",
      "D": "Maya wants to be in charge, while Jordan prefers to follow directions."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because the passage shows Maya organizing a meeting, creating a plan with her notebook, and working with a group to identify the root cause—the broken irrigation pipe. In contrast, Jordan immediately starts working alone without investigating, saying they can 'figure it out as we go.' The text demonstrates that Maya's methodical, collaborative approach solved the problem, while Jordan's quick, individual action failed to address the underlying issue.",

    "question": "Read the following passage:\n\nMaya and Jordan both tried out for the school play. Maya spent weeks memorizing her lines, practicing in front of her mirror each night. Jordan, on the other hand, preferred to improvise during rehearsals, making up different responses each time. While Maya felt most confident when she knew exactly what to say, Jordan enjoyed the excitement of not knowing what would happen next. In the end, both students got parts—Maya as the lead and Jordan in a supporting role that allowed for some improvisation.\n\nWhich choice best describes a difference between Maya and Jordan based on the passage?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Maya prefers preparation and practice, while Jordan enjoys spontaneity and improvisation.",
      "B": "Maya wanted the lead role, while Jordan refused to accept any part in the play.",
      "C": "Maya is a better actor than Jordan because she memorizes all of her lines.",
      "D": "Maya dislikes acting in plays, while Jordan has been in many plays before."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because the passage specifically states that Maya 'spent weeks memorizing her lines, practicing in front of her mirror each night' and 'felt most confident when she knew exactly what to say,' while Jordan 'preferred to improvise during rehearsals' and 'enjoyed the excitement of not knowing what would happen next.' These details directly show that Maya values preparation and practice, whereas Jordan prefers spontaneity and improvisation.",

    "question": "Read the passage: \n\nWhy We Should Protect Coral Reefs\n\nCoral reefs provide homes for many sea creatures. Scientists have found that about 25% of all ocean fish live in coral reefs, even though reefs cover only a small part of the ocean floor.\n\nCoral reefs also protect coastlines from storms. Large waves lose much of their energy when they hit coral reefs before reaching the shore. This helps prevent flooding and damage to coastal communities.\n\nFinally, coral reefs help scientists discover new medicines. Many medicines for treating infections and other illnesses come from plants and animals that live in coral reefs.\n\nWhich sentence from the passage provides evidence to support the point that coral reefs provide homes for many sea creatures?",

      "D": "This helps prevent flooding and damage to coastal communities."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because it provides specific evidence—a statistic showing that 25% of ocean fish live in coral reefs—that directly supports the point that coral reefs provide homes for many sea creatures. This evidence shows the connection between coral reefs and the creatures that depend on them for shelter.",

    "question": "Read the passage.\n\n\"Schools should extend recess time to twenty minutes daily. Extended recess improves students' physical health. Children who have longer recess periods engage in more vigorous physical activity, which strengthens their hearts and muscles. A 2019 study found that students with twenty-minute recesses took 30% more steps per day than students with ten-minute recesses. Furthermore, longer recess improves academic performance. After physical activity, students return to class more focused and ready to learn. Teachers report that students concentrate better following extended outdoor time. Finally, longer recess supports students' social development. Children practice conflict resolution and cooperation during unstructured play time, skills they need throughout life.\"\n\nThe author includes the evidence that \"students with twenty-minute recesses took 30% more steps per day than students with ten-minute recesses.\" Which point does this evidence support?",

    "question": "Read the passage: \"Regular exercise has many benefits for children. One benefit is that exercise helps build strong muscles. When children run, jump, and climb, their muscles work hard and become stronger over time. Another benefit is that exercise improves heart health. A strong heart pumps blood more efficiently throughout the body. For example, studies show that children who exercise regularly have lower resting heart rates than those who do not exercise.\" The author makes the point that exercise improves heart health. Which choice provides evidence to support this point?",
    "answer": "C",
