    "question": "Read the passage below.\n\n\"Every day, water travels through a continuous loop called the water cycle. First, the Sun’s heat causes water in oceans, lakes, and rivers to evaporate and rise into the sky as invisible vapor. As the vapor climbs, it cools and turns back into tiny droplets, forming clouds—this is condensation. When the droplets become heavy enough, they fall to Earth as rain, snow, or hail, a process known as precipitation. The water then collects in bodies of water or seeps into the ground, where it can start the cycle again. This cycle not only supplies fresh water for plants, animals, and people, but it also helps regulate the planet’s temperature by moving heat around the globe.\"\n\nWhich choice best summarizes the passage, correctly stating its two main ideas and providing at least one supporting detail for each?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The water cycle moves water through evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection, and it is essential because it provides fresh water for living things and helps regulate Earth’s temperature; the passage explains how heat causes evaporation and how clouds form through condensation.",

When the eggs hatch, the caterpillars emerge and spend most of their time eating leaves to grow. After growing enough, the caterpillars form a chrysalis, also called a pupa, where they change inside.

First, trees block the sun, keeping sidewalks cooler on hot days. Second, studies show that areas with many trees have lower levels of carbon dioxide. Finally, people who live near trees are less likely to develop asthma.\"\n\nWhich choice best explains how the author uses reasons and evidence to support the point that planting more trees benefits the community?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The author lists three reasons—shade, reduced pollution, and health—and provides specific evidence for each, such as cooler sidewalks, lower carbon‑dioxide levels, and reduced asthma rates, showing how each reason supports the main point.",

      "C": "The author argues that planting trees will increase property values, but does not give any specific evidence, so the point is unsupported.",
      "D": "The author states that trees are a traditional part of city landscapes, which is a reason for planting them but not linked to evidence."

      "A": "Bringing reusable water bottles is good because they look cool, they are easy to carry, and they help the school look nicer. Many kids think a cool bottle makes them popular.",
      "B": "Using reusable water bottles helps the environment, saves money, and keeps drinks cooler. Last year our school threw away about 500 pounds of plastic bottles, so using reusables would greatly reduce that waste. Students who switched saved about $10 each month because they no longer bought single‑use bottles. Reusable bottles are often insulated, which means the water stays colder longer during hot days.",
      "C": "Reusable bottles are better because they are stronger than plastic ones, they come in many colors, and they are made by famous brands. Some people say that stronger bottles never break, which is true for most of them.",
      "D": "If we all used reusable water bottles, the school would have fewer broken bottles, and teachers would have less to clean up. Also, many families already buy them for their kids, so it would be easy for everyone to start."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because it lists three reasons—environmental benefit, cost savings, and keeping drinks cooler—in a clear, logical order, and each reason is backed by specific facts or details (500 pounds of plastic waste, $10 monthly savings, insulated bottles keep water cold). The other options either lack supporting facts or do not present the reasons in a logically ordered way.",

      "A": "Reading daily can help students learn new words. It also makes them better at math. Teachers say reading is good.",
      "B": "Reading daily helps students learn new words because they see them often. Also, reading improves concentration, which can help with learning vocabulary. Teachers say reading is important.",
      "C": "Reading daily improves vocabulary in several ways. First, encountering words in different stories helps students see how they are used, which makes meanings clearer. Second, a 2022 study by the Education Research Institute showed that students who read 15 minutes each day learned an average of 12 new words per week, providing concrete evidence of growth. Third, discussing new words with classmates reinforces understanding, as teachers report higher quiz scores after group discussions.",
      "D": "Reading daily is fun and helps with imagination. Some kids like comics, some like novels. It's good for everyone."

    "answer_explanation": "Option C is correct because it presents three reasons that are explicitly ordered (first, second, third) and each reason is backed by specific facts or details—a description of how context clarifies meaning, a 2022 study with quantitative results, and teacher observations of higher quiz scores—fulfilling the requirement to provide logically ordered reasons supported by facts and details.",

      "B": "Reading every day is important for three reasons. First, it improves vocabulary; students who read 20 minutes a day learn about 2,000 new words each year. Second, it boosts imagination; stories let kids picture places they have never visited, which helps creativity. Third, it helps school performance; research shows that children who read at home score higher on standardized tests.",
      "C": "Reading every day helps you because you can learn new things, you can enjoy adventures, and you can relax. Some books are interesting, and many people read for fun. Reading is a popular activity among children.",
      "D": "Every day, reading can expose you to facts about history, science, and nature. It also introduces you to characters and plots. Books contain many pictures and diagrams."
