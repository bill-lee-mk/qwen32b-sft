    "question": "Read this folktale:\n\nKira lived in a mountain village where water was scarce. One day, while fetching water from a stream, she saw a small, injured sparrow. Despite her heavy bucket, Kira stopped to gently wrap the sparrow in a leaf and carry it home. She fed it crumbs and kept it warm. Her mother said, 'You waste time on a bird when we need water.' But Kira continued caring for the sparrow. After a week, the sparrow healed and flew away. That summer, a drought dried up the stream. Kira remembered the sparrow and followed where it had flown. There, hidden behind rocks, she found a fresh spring. The village had water again.\n\nWhich statement best explains the central message of the folktale and how a key detail conveys that message?",

Each week after that, the amount increased: 60 pounds in week two, 70 in week three, and 80 in week four. The principal announced that the money from selling the recycled paper will be used to buy books. Also, many teachers have commented that students are now thinking twice before using extra paper, which is a good habit for the environment. Some students even made posters to remind others to recycle.' Then you see a bar graph on the screen showing the pounds of paper collected each week: Week 1: 50, Week 2: 60, Week 3: 70, Week 4: 80.

    "question": "A student is researching bird migration. They recall seeing geese flying south last fall. They read a website that says: 'Geese migrate to warmer areas for food. They fly in V-shaped formations to save energy.' They also read a book that says: 'Some birds use landmarks like rivers to navigate. Geese often stop at lakes to rest.' The student must take brief notes and sort evidence into these categories: 1) Reasons for Migration 2) Migration Behaviors. Which choice shows notes that correctly follow W.3.8?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "1) For food (website); 2) Fly south (experience), V-formation (website), landmarks (book), lakes (book)",
      "B": "1) For food, warmer areas; 2) Fly south, V-formation, landmarks, lakes",
      "C": "1) Geese migrate to warmer areas for food; 2) They fly in V-shaped formations to save energy, use landmarks like rivers, and stop at lakes to rest.",
      "D": "1) Fly south (experience); 2) For food (website), V-formation (website), landmarks (book), lakes (book)"

    "question": "Jamie is writing a report about rainforest animals. Jamie gathered information from a book, a safe website, and a personal memory. Here are the notes Jamie took:\n\n1. 'Monkeys use their tails to swing from trees. (Rainforest Wonders book, page 10)'\n2. 'Parrots have bright feathers. (AnimalFacts.org)'\n3. 'I saw a sloth moving very slowly when I visited the zoo last year.

    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Put note 1 in 'Behaviors', note 2 in 'Physical Features', and note 3 in 'Behaviors.'",

      "D": "Put all notes in 'Physical Features.'"

This follows the standard by recalling information from experiences (note 3) and gathering from print and digital sources (notes 1 and 2), taking brief notes, and sorting evidence into provided categories.",
