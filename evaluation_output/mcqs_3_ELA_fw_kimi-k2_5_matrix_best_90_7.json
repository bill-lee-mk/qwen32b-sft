    "question": "Read the paragraph.\n\n\"Long ago, all the continents on Earth were joined together in one huge landmass. Over millions of years, powerful forces inside the planet caused the crust to crack and the sections to drift apart. Because the sections moved slowly in different directions, oceans formed between them. As the continents continued to shift, mountain ranges pushed upward where the plates collided. Today, the continents are still moving, which means the land will look different millions of years from now.\"\n\nWhich choice best describes the relationship between these events using time, sequence, and cause/effect language?",
    "answer": "A",

      "A": "Because forces cracked the crust, the sections drifted apart, causing oceans to form between them; as the plates continued to collide, mountains pushed upward.",

      "C": "Oceans formed between the landmasses first, which caused the crust to crack and the continents to drift apart; later, the sections shifted to push up mountains.",
      "D": "The sections drifted apart because mountains had already formed, causing the crust to crack and oceans to appear between the moving plates."

After the tree leaves grew thick, the shaded benches felt much nicer to sit on, and we stayed there during recess. The blacktop in the sun still burned our hands if we touched it.\"\n\nThen your teacher displays this line graph on the screen:\n\nThe graph title is \"Afternoon Playground Temperature (3:00 p.m.).\" It shows two lines over six weeks. The black line for \"Sunny Blacktop\" stays flat at 95 degrees. The green line for \"Shaded Garden\" starts at 92 degrees and drops to 82 degrees by week six.\n\nWhich option best states the MAIN IDEA and provides one supporting detail from the read‑aloud text and one supporting detail from the graph?",
