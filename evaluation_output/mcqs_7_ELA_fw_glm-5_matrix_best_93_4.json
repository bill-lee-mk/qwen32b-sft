The pieces were worn smooth from decades of use, and the board had a small crack in one corner. At first, I didn't understand why she had given me such a battered old game. But then she told me the story behind it.\n\nMy great-grandfather had learned to play chess as a boy in Poland, before his family immigrated to America in 1920. He carried this chess set across the ocean, through Ellis Island, and all the way to their new home in Chicago. The crack in the board, she explained, happened during the voyage when a wave rocked the ship so violently that everything below deck tumbled to the floor. He refused to throw away the damaged board, saying that its scars were part of its story now.\n\nAs I listened to my grandmother, I began to see the chess set differently. It wasn't just an old game—it was a survivor, a witness to history, a connection to ancestors I had never known. That afternoon, I learned that objects can carry stories across time, bridging generations and keeping memories alive.\n\nWhich choice best states the central idea of this passage?",

As the only student in my class who had recently arrived from another country, I spent months nodding along to conversations I barely understood. My teachers praised my \"good behavior,\" but inside, I was screaming to be heard.\n\nThen Mrs. Alvarez assigned us to write personal narratives. \"Write about something that changed you,\" she said. That night, I filled five pages with stories about my grandmother's garden, the market near our old apartment, and the ache of leaving everything familiar behind. When I read my essay aloud the next day, my hands trembled. But as I spoke the final sentence, a classmate raised her hand. \"I didn't know you felt that way,\" she said quietly. \"Thank you for telling us.\"\n\nThat moment taught me something I still carry: our stories have power. When we share our truths, we build bridges. I had thought my differences separated me from my classmates, but my story became a connection point instead.

What began as a few scattered projects has grown into a nationwide movement. These urban gardens serve multiple purposes that extend far beyond providing fresh vegetables.\n\nInitially, urban gardens were seen primarily as a solution to 'food deserts'—neighborhoods lacking access to fresh, affordable produce. Residents in underserved communities could grow their own healthy food, reducing dependence on distant grocery stores. As the movement expanded, however, another benefit became equally important: community building. Neighbors who once barely acknowledged each other now work side by side, sharing tools, seeds, and knowledge.\n\nToday, urban gardens address both nutrition and social connection. Studies show that neighborhoods with active garden programs report stronger social ties and improved mental health among participants. The gardens have evolved from simple food sources into centers of community life, demonstrating how one initiative can address multiple challenges simultaneously.\n\nWhich choice best describes how the two central ideas develop over the course of the passage?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Both central ideas are introduced together at the beginning and receive equal attention throughout the text.",
      "B": "The first central idea is presented initially, and the second central idea emerges and gains significance as the text progresses.",
      "C": "The two central ideas are presented as conflicting viewpoints, with one ultimately proving more valid than the other.",
      "D": "A single central idea is established in the opening and remains the sole focus, with no second idea developing."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because the passage first introduces the central idea that urban gardens address food deserts and provide nutrition. In the second paragraph, a second central idea emerges—that urban gardens build community and social connections—and this idea gains significance as the text progresses. By the conclusion, both central ideas are presented as interconnected purposes of urban gardens, showing how the second idea developed and became 'equally important' alongside the first.",

    "question": "Read the passage below and answer the question.\n\nThe Rise of Renewable Energy\n\nSolar panels gleam on rooftops across the nation. Wind turbines spin gracefully on hillsides. These renewable energy sources are transforming how Americans power their homes and businesses. In 2010, renewable energy provided only 10% of U.S. electricity. By 2020, that number had doubled to 20%. This growth shows no signs of slowing.\n\nThe shift to renewable energy brings significant economic benefits. The solar industry now employs more workers than coal, oil, and gas combined. In states like California and Texas, wind and solar projects have created thousands of jobs in rural communities. Farmers who once struggled to make ends meet now earn steady income by leasing land for wind turbines.\n\nEnvironmental improvements follow the expansion of renewable energy. As coal plants close, air quality in nearby cities has improved measurably. Children in these areas experience fewer asthma attacks. Wildlife habitats near renewable installations often thrive, unlike the damage caused by oil spills or coal mining.\n\nWhich choice identifies two central ideas developed in the passage?",

    "question": "Read the article below. Then answer the question.\n\n**The Silent Revolution: How Solar Energy Transformed a Village**\n\n[Section 1] For decades, the remote village of Mesa Verde existed in near isolation, its residents relying on kerosene lamps and diesel generators for power. The lack of reliable electricity limited educational opportunities, healthcare access, and economic development. Children studied by flickering lamplight; clinics struggled to preserve vaccines; businesses closed at sunset. This energy poverty created a cycle that seemed impossible to break.\n\n[Section 2] In 2015, a team of engineers arrived with an ambitious proposal: a community solar microgrid. They conducted surveys, assessed the village's needs, and designed a system tailored to Mesa Verde's geography and consumption patterns. By 2017, solar panels gleamed across the hillside, connected to batteries that could power the village through the night.\n\n[Section 3] The transformation was immediate and far-reaching. The village clinic now maintains proper refrigeration for medicines. A new evening study program has doubled high school graduation rates. Three new businesses have opened, creating jobs and keeping younger residents in the community. Perhaps most significantly, residents report a newfound sense of possibility—they no longer see their village as a place to escape, but as a place to build a future.\n\n[Section 4] Mesa Verde's success illustrates a broader principle: sustainable energy solutions do more than provide power—they reshape possibilities. As similar projects emerge worldwide, the Mesa Verde model offers a blueprint for communities facing energy poverty, proving that technological innovation, when thoughtfully implemented, can catalyze social and economic transformation.\n\nWhich statement best explains how Section 3 contributes to the overall structure and development of ideas in the article?",

Getting enough quality sleep affects nearly every aspect of our lives, from our physical health to our ability to learn and remember.\n\n**Physical Benefits:** During sleep, the body repairs tissues, builds muscle, and strengthens the immune system. Studies show that people who get seven to nine hours of sleep each night are less likely to get sick and recover faster from illness. Sleep also helps regulate hormones that control appetite, which is why lack of sleep can lead to weight gain.\n\n**Mental Benefits:** Sleep is equally important for mental functioning. While we sleep, the brain processes and stores information from the day, forming new memories. Students who get adequate sleep perform better on tests and have improved concentration. Lack of sleep, on the other hand, can lead to difficulty focusing, mood swings, and decreased problem-solving abilities.\n\n**Tips for Better Sleep:** Establishing a consistent sleep schedule helps regulate the body's internal clock. Avoiding screens before bedtime, creating a comfortable sleep environment, and limiting caffeine in the afternoon can all contribute to better sleep quality. Small changes in daily habits can make a significant difference.\n\n**Conclusion:** Understanding the importance of sleep is the first step toward prioritizing it. By recognizing both the physical and mental benefits of adequate rest and implementing practical strategies, anyone can improve their sleep habits and, consequently, their overall well-being.\n\nWhich choice best describes how the \"Tips for Better Sleep\" section contributes to the overall structure and development of ideas in the text?",

Supporters of traditional homework policies argue that it builds responsibility and reinforces classroom learning. However, this position ignores a crucial reality: excessive homework often diminishes the very outcomes it claims to promote.\n\nProponents of homework point to studies showing modest academic benefits, particularly for older students.

Research from the National Sleep Foundation indicates that teenagers need 8-10 hours of sleep per night, but most adolescents get only 7 hours on average. A 2018 study of Seattle public schools, which shifted start times from 7:50 AM to 8:45 AM, found that students gained an average of 34 minutes of sleep per night and saw a 4.5% increase in grades. Furthermore, a survey conducted at Riverview last month revealed that 78% of students participate in after-school sports or clubs, and many of these students reported feeling tired during morning classes. Finally, the American Academy of Pediatrics has officially recommended that middle and high schools start no earlier than 8:30 AM. Given this substantial body of evidence, the school board must approve the later start time immediately.\"\n\nWhich evaluation best identifies a significant flaw in the reasoning or a problem with the relevance or sufficiency of the evidence?",
    "answer": "C",

      "A": "The reasoning is flawed because the National Sleep Foundation's research about sleep duration does not prove that a later start time will actually increase student sleep.",

    "answer_explanation": "Option C is correct because the survey evidence about after-school activities and student tiredness does not directly support the claim that a later start time would reduce sleep deprivation. While the survey indicates that many students feel tired in the morning, it provides no data about whether shifting the start time would address this issue. The survey results are therefore irrelevant to evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Relevant evidence would need to demonstrate a connection between start times and improved sleep outcomes, which this survey does not establish.",

    "question": "Read the following passage:\n\nMaya had always been impatient. In the city, if she wanted something, she got it immediately—takeout delivered in minutes, answers from a quick internet search, entertainment on demand. But the remote mountain cabin had no cell service, no delivery drivers, and no instant gratification. During the long winter, she learned that firewood needed to be gathered hours before it could warm the house, that bread took all day to rise, and that the frozen lake wouldn't thaw just because she wanted to go swimming. By spring, Maya had discovered something unexpected: the satisfaction of waiting for things worth waiting for.\n\nWhich choice best explains how the setting interacts with Maya's character development in the passage?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The mountain setting makes Maya resent the lack of modern conveniences and long for city life.",
      "B": "The isolated setting forces Maya to develop patience by removing the instant gratification she relied upon in the city.",
      "C": "The winter setting causes Maya to become fearful of the harsh natural elements surrounding the cabin.",
      "D": "The remote setting encourages Maya to build relationships with neighbors to combat her loneliness."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because the passage demonstrates a clear interaction between the setting and character development: the mountain cabin's lack of cell service, delivery services, and instant gratification directly forces Maya to change from an impatient person to someone who appreciates waiting. The setting creates conditions that require patience (gathering firewood hours early, waiting for bread to rise, accepting the frozen lake), which leads to her discovery of 'the satisfaction of waiting for things worth waiting for.' This shows how the setting shapes the character's growth.",

    "question": "Read the following passage:\n\nMaya grew up in a lighthouse on a remote rocky island, where fierce storms raged for weeks at a time. The constant howling winds and crashing waves made her develop an acute awareness of sounds. She learned to distinguish between the warning signals of approaching ships and the ordinary roar of the sea. Years later, when Maya moved to the quiet countryside, she struggled to sleep without the familiar rhythm of the ocean.\n\nWhich choice best describes how the setting influences Maya's character?",

    "question": "Historical records indicate that during the 1849 California Gold Rush, mining camps were predominantly populated by men, with very few women present. Those women who did come often worked as cooks, laundresses, or entertainers rather than miners. In the novel 'Gold Mountain Dreams,' the author portrays a diverse mining camp where women and men work side by side as equal partners in mining operations, and the main character is a young woman who successfully runs her own claim. Which choice best explains the author's purpose in altering the historical reality of gold rush mining camps?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "To prove that historical accounts excluded important female miners",
      "B": "To create a protagonist who challenges period expectations, allowing modern readers to connect with the story",
      "C": "To show that women were actually more successful at mining than men",
      "D": "To demonstrate that the gold rush was less dangerous than historians claim"
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because the author's alteration serves a literary purpose rather than attempting to correct the historical record. By creating a female protagonist who defies the gender norms of the 1849 Gold Rush era, the author enables contemporary readers to connect with the historical setting through a relatable character. This demonstrates how fiction authors alter history to serve narrative goals—specifically, creating protagonists and themes that resonate with modern audiences while still engaging with a historical period.",

    "question": "In a historical account of the California Gold Rush, most miners left with little or no profit, and many lost everything they had invested. A novel set during the Gold Rush portrays the main character striking it rich and living happily ever after. Which choice best explains why the author of the fiction altered the historical reality?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The author wanted to create an inspiring story with a satisfying conclusion, even though it differs from typical historical outcomes.",

      "D": "The author wanted to make the story shorter by removing the details about unsuccessful miners."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because authors of fiction often alter historical facts to create more engaging narratives. In this case, changing the typical outcome of the Gold Rush allows the author to craft an inspiring story with a satisfying conclusion, which is a common reason authors modify historical reality in their works.",

My brain felt sharper and more flexible.'\n\nWhich statement best evaluates whether the evidence is relevant to the claim?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The evidence is relevant because it connects learning a second language to improved problem-solving abilities.",

A Stanford University study found that 56% of students consider homework their primary source of stress. Furthermore, Finland's education system, which assigns almost no homework, consistently ranks among the top globally. Just yesterday, my neighbor's son spent four hours on math worksheets instead of playing outside or reading for pleasure. The research is clear: homework harms students and provides no educational benefit.\"\n\nWhich choice best evaluates whether the reasoning and evidence in this argument are sound?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The reasoning is sound because the Stanford study and Finland comparison provide strong, relevant evidence that homework is harmful.",
      "B": "The reasoning is partially sound but the evidence is insufficient because the Stanford study shows student perceptions rather than actual harm, and Finland's success may result from factors beyond homework policy.",
      "C": "The reasoning is unsound because the personal anecdote about the neighbor's son is irrelevant to the broader argument about homework's educational value.",
      "D": "The reasoning is sound because combining research statistics with a real-world example creates a convincing, well-supported argument."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because it accurately identifies flaws in the argument's reasoning. The Stanford study measures student perceptions of stress, not actual harm caused by homework, so it does not fully support the claim that homework 'harms students.' Additionally, the Finland comparison commits a logical fallacy: just because Finland has little homework and high rankings does not prove that homework policy causes their success—other factors such as teacher training, curriculum design, or class size could be responsible. A sound argument would require evidence directly linking homework to harm and demonstrating that reducing homework alone would improve educational outcomes.",

My friend Sarah started coding last year and now helps her parents with their business website. A 2022 survey found that 78% of students who take coding classes enjoy them. If we want students to succeed in the future, we must make coding mandatory for everyone.'\"\n\nWhich choice best evaluates whether Chen's evidence is sufficient to support his claim?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The evidence is sufficient because it includes both personal stories and survey data.",
      "B": "The evidence is insufficient because personal anecdotes and enjoyment statistics do not prove that coding should be mandatory for all students.",

      "D": "The evidence is insufficient because the author does not explain what coding means."
