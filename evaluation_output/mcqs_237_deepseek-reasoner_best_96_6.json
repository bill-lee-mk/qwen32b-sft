She wished to see the world from such heights, but her family's farm kept her busy. Each morning, before chores, Lara climbed a tall pine tree near her home. She balanced carefully on the branches, feeling the wind and gazing at the distant horizons. Her brother teased her, saying, \"Dreaming won't feed the goats.\" Lara kept climbing, day after day, year after year, strengthening her legs and learning to read the wind's shifts. One autumn, a rockslide blocked the only path to the village, trapping supplies. Rescue teams needed someone agile to scout a new route from above.
