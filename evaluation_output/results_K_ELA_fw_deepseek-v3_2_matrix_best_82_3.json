The prompt does not specify \"the most important\" or \"the event that causes the problem,\" creating ambiguity and multiple plausible correct answers.\n- ISSUE2 (distractor_quality): Option A is also a correct example of a major event, so it is not a true distractor.

Metadata: correct answer A and explanation.\n\nStep 2: Issues\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key = A; explanation references option A text correctly; all fields consistent → no factual mismatch.\n- Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): No answer revealed in student-facing text; keys/explanations are metadata → no giveaway.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus present → N/A (pass).\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Stem and options are clean, age-appropriate; no merged words or stray symbols.\nNo issues identified across metrics.\n\nScoring per metrics: With no identified issues, all binary metrics = 1.0. Overall must be in 0.85–1.0 range. Choose 0.93 (acceptable, solid quality). Provide minor improvement suggestion under overall despite passes.\n\nRationale summary: Clear stem asks for a sentence that names an animal and provides a true fact; A (“Dogs bark.”) satisfies both. B is subjective/personal, C is overgeneral/opinion, D names but lacks information. Aligns with W.K.2 recognition of informative elements. Distractors are plausible and diagnostic.
