The bins are color‑coded: blue for paper, green for plastic, and yellow for cans. Students who bring their lunch in reusable containers have helped cut down on waste. The school also holds a monthly ‘Recycle‑and‑Win’ contest where classes earn points for the amount they recycle.”\n\nThe class then looks at a bar graph that shows the amount of each material recycled last month:\n- Paper: 80 pounds\n- Plastic: 70 pounds\n- Cans: 60 pounds\n\nWhich choice correctly states the main idea of the passage and provides two supporting details, one from the spoken paragraph and one from the bar graph?",

    "question": "A student is researching how squirrels get ready for winter. The teacher gives three sources and three categories. The student must take brief notes on each source, label the source, and sort each piece of evidence into the correct category. Which choice shows notes that correctly follow the standard?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Food storage:\n- Book: squirrels collect nuts and bury them in the ground to eat later in winter.\n- Observation: I watched a squirrel stash acorns in a small hole behind the park bench last week.\nNest building:\n- Website: squirrels line the inside of their nests with leaves and twigs for extra warmth.\nPhysical changes:\n- (none)",

    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because the student took brief notes (only key words), labeled each note with its source (Book, Website, Observation), and placed each piece of evidence into the appropriate category (Food storage, Nest building). The other options have problems: A uses a full‑sentence note from the book, which is not brief; C places the observation in the wrong category and includes a full sentence for the website; D adds information (thicker fur) that is not found in any source and does not follow the requirement to use only the given evidence.",

    "question": "Lena is preparing a short report about forest animals. She gathers information from three places: (1) a book called \"Forest Friends\" that says \"Deer eat leaves and twigs.\" (2) a kid‑friendly website that states \"Owls hunt at night.\" (3) Her own observation that she saw a squirrel gathering nuts in her backyard. Her teacher asks her to write brief notes that include the source and then place each note into the correct category: \"Herbivores\" or \"Carnivores.\" Which choice shows the best way for Lena to record the notes and sort the evidence?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Note 1: Deer eat leaves and twigs. (Forest Friends) – Herbivores; Note 2: Owls hunt at night. (KidsNature.com) – Carnivores; Note 3: Squirrel gathering nuts. (My observation) – Herbivores.",
      "B": "Note 1: Deer eat leaves and twigs. (Forest Friends) – Carnivores; Note 2: Owls hunt at night. (KidsNature.com) – Carnivores; Note 3: Squirrel gathering nuts. (My observation) – Herbivores.",

    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because each brief note includes the source and the information is placed in the appropriate category: deer are herbivores, owls are carnivores, and the squirrel (which gathers nuts) is a herbivore. The other options mis‑categorize at least one animal.",
