Inferred: Students may treat “notorious” as a neutral synonym of “famous.”\n- Item Specifications: None provided.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\n- Question Type: MCQ practice/assessment. Student-facing content includes a clear stem and four options. Answer key and explanation appear as metadata only.\n\nStep 2 – Issues Identified:\n- No issues identified. Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n  • Checklist A (Field Consistency): The labeled correct answer is C (“notorious”), which matches the explanation and the options.

The denotation framing “widely known” is acceptable in this pedagogical context. Correct answer and explanation align.\n- Educational Accuracy: Directly assesses connotation in context for grade 7; no giveaways.\n- Curriculum Alignment: Aligns precisely with L.7.5.C (connotation distinctions among near-synonyms) using a positive-honor context to surface negative connotation.\n- Clarity & Precision: Clear task—identify the term inappropriate due to negative connotation in an honoring speech.\n- Specification Compliance: Requested type is mcq; content provides 4 options. No conflicting specs provided.\n- Reveals Misconceptions: Plausible misconception that “notorious” ~ “famous.” Item diagnoses this effectively.\n- Difficulty Alignment: Scenario 3. For grade 7, distinguishing connotations among near-synonyms in a realistic context is appropriate; arguably medium difficulty, but absence of authoritative definitions means no clear mismatch with the labeled “hard.”\n- Passage Reference: No passage required; self-contained.\n- Distractor Quality: Options are parallel, plausible in positive context except the targeted negative “notorious.” Balanced length and specificity.\n- Stimulus Quality: No stimulus; pass by default.\n- Mastery Learning Alignment: Requires application of vocabulary knowledge to context (not pure recall).\n- Localization Quality: Neutral, universally understandable scenario.\n\nOverall Score Determination:\n- C=0 (no failures in critical metrics), N=0 (no failures in non-critical metrics).

The item asks for the most precise domain-specific term in a scientific context → aligned.\n- Common Misconceptions: None provided. Used general pedagogy: students may confuse general terms (progression) or related biological terms (propagation) or human-driven processes (cultivation) with the ecological process.\n- Item Specifications: None provided.\n\nB. Standard Evaluation Process\nStep 1: Intent → Practice/assessment MCQ for vocabulary precision.\nStep 2: Issues\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): The labeled correct answer (A: succession) matches the stem and explanation; explanation accurately defines the concept in ecology; options exist and correspond to referenced terms. No mismatches.\n- Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): No student-facing giveaways; the answer and explanation are in metadata only.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus present; N/A.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Stem and choices are clear, grammatical, and unambiguous. No merged words or stray symbols.\nResult: No issues identified.

No other specs to enforce.\n- Reveals Misconceptions: Distractors map to plausible misunderstandings: \"progression\" (general academic term), \"propagation\" (reproduction/spread, not community assembly), \"cultivation\" (human-managed growth).\n- Difficulty Alignment: For Grade 7, selecting precise domain-specific vocabulary among plausible distractors is around Medium; labeled \"hard\" but not a clear mismatch warranting failure per Scenario 3.\n- Passage Reference: Not applicable; self-contained.\n- Distractor Quality: Parallel, concise, and plausible; none trivially wrong; correct option not telegraphed.\n- Stimulus Quality: No stimulus; pass by default.\n- Mastery Learning Alignment: Requires applying conceptual understanding of ecological processes to select the precise term; diagnostic value present.\n\nC.

This item requires recognizing the introduction of nutrition/food-desert focus, the emergence of community-building, and the shift to equal importance—appropriate for upper middle-grade cognitive demand.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided. No violations noted.\n- Learning Objectives: RI.7.2—determine two or more central ideas and analyze their development. This question targets analyzing how two ideas develop over the passage; no summary task is included but that’s not required for every item. Alignment strong.\n- Common Misconceptions: None provided. Plausible misconceptions addressed by distractors: (A) assuming both ideas are introduced together/equally emphasized; (D) assuming only one idea; (C) misreading ideas as conflicting.\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Generation prompt requested type: mcq. The item includes 4 answer options; compliant.\n\nB. Standard Evaluation Process:\n- Step 1: Determined it is a practice/assessment MCQ with a short passage and four options.\n- Step 2 – Issues: No concrete issues identified.\n  • Checklist A (Field Consistency): Labeled correct answer B matches the passage and explanation. Options referenced accurately.\n  • Checklist B (Answer Giveaway): No pre-attempt giveaways. Student must analyze development across paragraphs.\n  • Checklist C (Diction/Typo): No typos or merged non-words; clear phrasing.\n\nC. Deviation Justification: None—no deviation from curriculum data was required; absence of detailed specs/definitions noted and handled via Scenario 3 for difficulty.\n\nOverall scoring per rules: C=0 (no critical metric fails), N=0 (no non-critical fails) → allowed overall range 0.85–1.0. Selected 0.95 (acceptable, high quality, minor improvement possible in distractor plausibility balance).",

This item matches “easy.”\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided. No boundaries to enforce.\n- Learning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Identify and explain how setting influences a character’s traits or behavior.\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided.

Student-facing content: passage + stem + options. Metadata: answer key and explanation (hidden in normal UI).

The item asks students to analyze how a soliloquy (form/structure of drama) contributes to meaning—directly aligned to RL.7.5. No Curriculum API Difficulty Definitions provided for this standard; using Scenario 3: own assessment of difficulty. Assessment Boundaries, Learning Objectives, Common Misconceptions, and Item Specifications are not provided; treated as absent and used general pedagogical expectations. \n\nGeneration prompt/type check: Requested type = mcq. The item provides four labeled options (A–D) and a single correct answer key “A” → matches requested format.\n\nStep 1 (gather): Student-facing content includes a brief dramatic excerpt with explicit stage direction indicating the character is alone (typical cue for soliloquy), followed by a question about how the soliloquy’s structure contributes to meaning, with four answer choices. Metadata marks correct = A; explanation supports A with accurate definition of soliloquy and its effect (audience access to private thoughts; dramatic irony).\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): No mismatches. The labeled correct answer (A) matches both the content and the explanation. Options correspond to plausible interpretations.\n- Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): None; no pre-attempt reveal of the correct answer.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): The dramatic excerpt is coherent and accurately reflects a soliloquy. No contradictions or misleading elements.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Clear, grammatical, and precise.\nNo issues identified. Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nMetric considerations:\n- Factual accuracy: The explanation correctly defines soliloquy and its function; the scene matches that definition (Maya alone on stage; introspective lines).\n- Educational accuracy: Cleanly targets structure-to-meaning analysis (RL.7.5). No giveaway. \n- Curriculum alignment: Strong alignment to RL.7.5. No boundaries specified to enforce.\n- Clarity & precision: Wording is unambiguous; task is clear.\n- Specification compliance: No applicable hard spec provided; format matches requested MCQ.\n- Reveals misconceptions & distractor quality: B and C reflect common misunderstandings (rehearsal; direct address/asking advice), D reflects over-moralized inference; all plausible but distinct from correct analysis.\n- Difficulty alignment: For Grade 7, analyzing a soliloquy’s contribution to meaning is appropriate and at least medium difficulty; with nuanced distractors, acceptable as “hard.”\n- Passage reference/stimulus quality: Properly referenced; stimulus is appropriate and not misleading.\n- Mastery learning: Requires analysis of structure and character, not recall.\n- Localization: Neutral and appropriate.\n\nOverall: With no identified issues (C=0, N=0), all discrete metrics pass. Chose 0.95 (Acceptable, strong) rather than 0.99+, as the item is solid and standard, not exceptionally innovative.",

Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nMetric scoring rationale:\n- Factual accuracy: Correct option (B) accurately synthesizes the enumerated benefits; explanation consistent.\n- Educational accuracy: Cleanly assesses identifying a main idea from an oral report; no pre-attempt giveaway; appropriate to SL.7.2.\n- Curriculum alignment: Directly matches SL.7.2 focus (diverse media; main idea vs details).\n- Clarity & precision: Unambiguous task (“Which choice best states the main idea…”).\n- Specification compliance: No explicit spec; format matches requested MCQ.\n- Reveals misconceptions: Distractors are plausible single details (common error vs main idea).\n- Difficulty alignment: For “easy,” the main idea is an explicit generalization of listed details—appropriate for Gr 7 SL.7.2.\n- Passage reference: Self-contained scenario; no missing passage.\n- Distractor quality: Parallel, plausible, homogeneous; correct choice not telegraphed beyond expected generality.\n- Stimulus quality: N/A (no image/audio provided to assess); pass by default as no harmful stimulus.\n- Mastery learning: Requires synthesis (main idea) rather than recall.\n- Localization quality: Neutral, appropriate context.\n\nDeterministic Overall: C=0 (no critical metric failures), N=0 → overall must be 0.85–1.0. Item is solid and clean; choose 0.95 (acceptable, near the high end but not claiming exceptional).\n",

The item does not measure adapting speech or command of formal English.\n- ISSUE3 (reveals_misconceptions): Distractors are placeholders (“An incorrect distractor.”) and do not reflect plausible misunderstandings about adapting speech/register.\n- ISSUE4 (difficulty_alignment): Labeled “hard,” but the answer is telegraphed by Option A’s wording, making it trivial and far below grade-appropriate cognitive demand for SL.7.6.\n- ISSUE5 (distractor_quality): Options are not plausible or comparable; one literally declares correctness while others are generic “incorrect distractor,” telegraphing the answer and lacking parallel specificity.\n- ISSUE6 (mastery_learning_alignment): No reasoning or application required; the answer can be chosen by copying the meta-label rather than evaluating language use or context.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key = A; explanation states A is correct. No internal mismatches among fields.\nChecklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): Fails—explicit giveaway in student-facing option A.\nChecklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus present—N/A.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No typos or merged non-words.\n\nDeterministic Scoring: Critical metric failures—educational_accuracy=0.0 (C=1).

I applied a general bar for 7th-grade ELA: Hard items typically require fine-grained evaluation among closely matched, credible sources and nuanced distinctions of relevance; Medium items allow clear discrimination among obviously weaker evidence (anecdote, biased source, irrelevant claim) vs. a credible study.\n\nAssessment Boundaries: None provided.\n\nLearning Objectives: None provided. Inferred objective: Evaluate and select evidence that is both relevant to a stated claim and from a credible source.\n\nCommon Misconceptions: None provided. Inferred likely misconceptions: confusing popularity/preference with evidence of effectiveness; relying on anecdotal observations; overvaluing biased or non-expert sources; using claims that don’t address the outcome in the claim.\n\nItem Specifications: None provided.

Option B cites a credible source (CDC) and outcomes (grades, attendance) that match the claim’s focus on academic performance; not a material factual error within the item.\n- Educational accuracy/curriculum alignment: Strong alignment with W.7.1.B.\n- Difficulty alignment: Labeled “hard,” but item feels more Medium; however, not a ≥2-grade mismatch and acceptable within 7th-grade expectations → pass per rules.\n- Distractor quality: A (single-school preference survey), C (biased, irrelevant stereotype), D (single-teacher anecdote) are plausible but inferior; they reveal misconceptions about credibility/relevance.\n\nOverall scoring rule: C=0 (no critical metric fails), N=0 (no non-critical fails) → overall must be in 0.85–1.0.

Curriculum Data Usage\n- Confidence Level: SOFT (from provided curriculum context)\n- Standard: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.7.3.A – Engage and orient the reader by establishing a context and point of view and introducing a narrator and/or characters; organize an event sequence that unfolds naturally and logically.\n- Difficulty Definitions: None provided in curriculum context → Scenario 3 used (constructed difficulty bar for Grade 7 ELA: “Hard” should require nuanced discrimination among plausible narrative openings/structures, multiple criteria evaluation—context, POV, characterization, sequencing—and potentially revision/analysis across multi-sentence options.)\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided.\n- Learning Objectives: None provided; inferred objective is: select or produce narrative elements that establish context/POV and organize events logically.\n- Common Misconceptions: None provided; inferred common errors include: missing/unclear context, POV shifts, failure to introduce narrator/characters, illogical sequencing.\n- Item Specifications: None provided.\n\nB. Standard Evaluation Process\nStep 1: Question type intent → Practice/assessment MCQ (prompt asks to choose, no instructional walkthrough; generation metadata type: \"mcq\").\n\nStep 2: Issues (committed list)\n- ISSUE1 (educational_accuracy): Giveaway in student-facing option text. Snippet: \"A: The correct choice that matches the standard.\" This trivially tells students which option to pick before attempt, failing the “trivial test.”\n- ISSUE2 (curriculum_alignment): Stem: \"Which choice best demonstrates the skill described in W.7.3.A at hard difficulty?\" with options that are meta-labels (not narrative content). The item does not assess establishing context, POV, narrator/characters, or logical event sequencing.\n- ISSUE3 (distractor_quality): Options \"An incorrect distractor.\" / \"Another incorrect distractor.\" are generic and implausible; provide no meaningful contrast with a correct narrative example.\n- ISSUE4 (reveals_misconceptions): Because distractors are non-substantive, the item cannot surface misconceptions like POV shifts or missing context.\n- ISSUE5 (difficulty_alignment): Labeled difficulty = hard, but the presence of option text explicitly labeled as \"The correct choice\" makes the task trivial rather than hard.\n- ISSUE6 (mastery_learning_alignment): No reasoning or application is required; students can answer by copying the meta-labeled correct option. No diagnostic value.\n\nChecklists:\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key = A; explanation references Option A; options exist. No internal mismatches.

FAIL → educational_accuracy issue recorded (ISSUE1).\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus present.

Deviation Justification: None needed beyond SOFT confidence handling and Scenario 3 difficulty assessment.\n\nDeterministic Scoring Mapping:\n- Critical fails: educational_accuracy = 0.0 (C=1)\n- Non-critical fails: curriculum_alignment, reveals_misconceptions, difficulty_alignment, distractor_quality, mastery_learning_alignment (N=5)\n→ Overall must be in 0.55–0.75; choose lower half due to critical failure and multiple non-critical failures.",

Add subtle contrasts in POV consistency and temporal cues.\n- Add an evidence-based explanation keyed to specific features in the correct option (context cues, POV markers, narrator intro, sequencing transitions)."

For Grade 7 ELA, Medium = analyze/evaluate sufficiency/relevance of evidence in a short excerpt with mixed evidence types; choose best evaluation among plausible claims.\n- Assessment boundaries: None provided.\n- Learning objectives: Not provided; inferred: evaluate whether presented evidence sufficiently supports an argumentative claim; distinguish anecdotal vs. generalizable evidence; recognize relevance vs. sufficiency.\n- Common misconceptions: Not provided; inferred: believing anecdotal evidence or high enjoyment percentages suffice to prove a mandate; focusing on definitional gaps instead of evidentiary sufficiency.\n- Item specifications: None provided.\n- Requested format type: request.type = \"mcq\"; content includes 4 populated options (A–D) → compliant.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (committed before scoring):\n- ISSUE1 (factual_accuracy): Snippet: \"In her essay 'Why Every Student Should Learn Coding,' technology writer Marcus Chen argues... He writes:\" Contradictory pronouns for the same author (\"her\" vs. later \"He\") create an internal inconsistency about the author’s gender/pronoun reference. This is an internal contradiction in student-facing text.\n\nChecklist results:\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Correct answer labeled B; explanation matches options and rationale. Only inconsistency is pronoun contradiction noted above.\n- Checklist B (Answer Giveaway): No pre-attempt giveaways. No images.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): No merged words or stray symbols; only the pronoun inconsistency.\n\nScoring mechanics per rules:\n- Critical metric failures: factual_accuracy = 0.0 (C=1)\n- Non-critical failures: none (N=0)\n- Overall must be in [0.70, 0.84]; because a critical metric failed, choose lower half → 0.74.\n",
