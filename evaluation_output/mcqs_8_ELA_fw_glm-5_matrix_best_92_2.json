I knew that our town was right to maintain its traditions, that the newcomers stirring up trouble were outsiders who didn't understand our ways, and that my father—standing tall on the courthouse steps—was on the side of justice. I knew these things the way I knew the sun would rise: without question, without doubt.\n\nThen came Mrs. Delacroix. She arrived with a battered suitcase and a teaching certificate from somewhere up North, sent to fill a vacancy no local educator would touch. She taught at the school across town, the one I'd never attended, the one whose students I'd never spoken to. But fate—or perhaps something more deliberate—brought us together when my bicycle chain snapped near her rented room on Oak Street.\n\nShe invited me inside for a glass of water. I remember the room: a single bed, a desk piled with books, a window overlooking the dusty street. What I remember most, though, is what she said when I spotted a photograph on her desk—a group of young people, some dark-skinned, some light-skinned, all smiling together.\n\n\"That was my students in Philadelphia,\" she said. \"Before I came here.\"\n\nI said nothing. I had never seen such a photograph. I had never imagined such a photograph could exist.\n\n\"Things are changing,\" she told me, her voice quiet but steady. \"They're changing whether we want them to or not. The question isn't whether change will come. The question is which side of it you'll be on when it does.\"\n\nI left her room with my bicycle chain still broken, walking home in the sweltering heat. My certainty had cracked open like ice on a winter pond, and through the fractures poured a thousand questions I had never before thought to ask. That summer, I learned that the most dangerous thing in the world is not doubt—it is certainty unexamined.\n\nBased on the passage, which statement best describes how the narrator's understanding of \"certainty\" changes?",

The book became an instant bestseller and was translated into multiple European languages. Douglass wrote with unflinching honesty about the brutal realities of slavery, describing in vivid detail the physical violence and psychological torment he endured. His eloquent prose and powerful arguments against slavery reached audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. However, the book's success came with a dangerous cost: by revealing specific details about his past, Douglass made himself identifiable to his former enslaver, who might seek to recapture him. Recognizing this threat, Douglass fled to England, where he continued his abolitionist work and gained support from British activists. During his two years abroad, he gave hundreds of speeches and raised funds to legally purchase his freedom. When Douglass returned to America in 1847 as a free man, he launched his own newspaper, 'The North Star,' continuing his lifelong fight for justice.\n\nWhich choice best describes the central idea of this passage?",

Then answer the question.\n\nThe Evolution of Communication\n\nThroughout history, humanity has continually sought faster and more efficient ways to communicate across distances. In ancient times, messengers on foot or horseback carried vital information across empires, a process that could take weeks or even months. The invention of the printing press in the 15th century revolutionized the spread of written information, making books and news accessible to broader audiences for the first time. However, the most dramatic transformation came with the telegraph in the 1830s, which allowed messages to travel almost instantly across vast distances through electrical signals.\n\nThe 20th century brought even more rapid advances. Radio and television transformed communication into a shared, real-time experience, allowing millions to receive the same news simultaneously. The development of the internet in the late 20th century marked another turning point, democratizing information access and enabling instant global communication. Today, smartphones and social media have further accelerated this evolution, allowing individuals to share information with worldwide audiences in seconds.\n\nYet this rapid progress raises important questions. While communication has become faster and more accessible, concerns about misinformation, privacy, and the quality of human connections have emerged. The challenge now facing society is not how to communicate faster, but how to communicate more responsibly in an age of instant information.\n\nWhich choice best describes the central idea and how supporting ideas develop it throughout the passage?",

However, these nonrenewable resources come with significant drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Additionally, fossil fuel reserves are finite—once they are depleted, they cannot be replaced.\n\nIn response to these challenges, renewable energy sources have gained momentum worldwide. Solar power harnesses energy from the sun through photovoltaic panels, while wind energy captures the power of moving air through large turbines. Hydropower generates electricity from flowing water, and geothermal energy taps into heat from beneath the Earth's surface. Unlike fossil fuels, these sources are constantly replenished by natural processes.\n\nThe shift toward renewables has accelerated in recent years due to several factors. Technological advances have made renewable energy more efficient and affordable than ever before. Government policies and incentives have encouraged both businesses and homeowners to adopt clean energy solutions. Furthermore, growing public awareness of climate change has increased demand for sustainable alternatives.\n\nToday, many countries are setting ambitious goals to transition entirely to renewable energy. Some nations already generate the majority of their electricity from clean sources. While challenges remain—such as storing energy for use when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing—innovations in battery technology continue to address these obstacles.

Preservationists, led by John Muir, argued that nature should remain untouched, protected from human interference entirely. Conservationists, championed by Gifford Pinchot, maintained that natural resources should be managed wisely for sustainable human use. The tension between these philosophies mirrors the difference between a museum curator and a librarian. A museum curator preserves artifacts behind glass, allowing observation but preventing interaction. A librarian, by contrast, lends books for active use while ensuring they remain available for future readers. Both approaches value their collections, yet they diverge fundamentally in how that value should be realized. Muir's advocacy for national parks as 'cathedrals of nature' positioned wilderness as sacred space, while Pinchot's concept of 'the greatest good for the greatest number' treated forests as renewable resources. Their debate over Hetch Hetchy Valley—whether to dam it for San Francisco's water supply—embodied this divide. The dam's construction in 1913 represented a victory for conservation, yet the decades of conflict it generated demonstrated that the distinction between these philosophies was not merely theoretical but deeply consequential.

In primary succession, bare rock or lifeless terrain is gradually colonized by pioneer species such as lichens and mosses. These hardy organisms break down rock into soil, enabling more complex plants to take root. In secondary succession, an existing ecosystem recovers from a disturbance such as a fire or flood, with the soil already intact. While both processes lead to increasingly diverse and stable communities, secondary succession typically occurs much faster because the soil foundation remains. This distinction explains why forests regrow relatively quickly after wildfires but take centuries to develop on newly formed volcanic islands.

    "question": "Read the following paragraph:\n\n'Pollinators play a crucial role in maintaining healthy ecosystems and ensuring food security worldwide. Bees, butterflies, and other pollinating species are responsible for transferring pollen between flowers, which enables plants to produce fruits, vegetables, and seeds. In fact, approximately one-third of the food we eat depends on pollination, including staples like apples, almonds, and blueberries. However, pollinator populations are declining at an alarming rate due to habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change. This decline threatens not only biodiversity but also global food production and human nutrition. To address this crisis, scientists recommend creating pollinator-friendly habitats and reducing pesticide use in agricultural areas.'\n\nWhich choice best describes the role of the sentence 'In fact, approximately one-third of the food we eat depends on pollination, including staples like apples, almonds, and blueberries' in developing the key concept of the paragraph?",

    "question": "Read the following passage:\n\nThe Case for Later School Start Times\n\nScientific research overwhelmingly supports later school start times for adolescents. Studies show that teenagers' biological clocks naturally shift during puberty, making it difficult for them to fall asleep before 11 p.m. When schools require students to arrive by 7:30 a.m., many teens get fewer than seven hours of sleep—well below the recommended 8-10 hours. This sleep deficit contributes to poor academic performance, increased rates of depression, and higher accident rates among young drivers.\n\nOpponents of later start times raise legitimate concerns about logistics. They point out that changing school schedules would complicate transportation arrangements, since the same buses often serve multiple schools. Parents worry about childcare conflicts, especially families where older siblings supervise younger children after school. Athletic directors note that later dismissals would push sports practices into evening hours, reducing time for homework and family activities.\n\nThese practical challenges are real, but they are not insurmountable. Districts that have shifted to later start times report that communities adapt within the first year. Schools have coordinated bus schedules more efficiently, created before-school programs for working parents, and adjusted athletic schedules to preserve family time. The initial adjustment period is challenging, but the long-term benefits to student health and achievement justify the effort.\n\nWhich statement best describes how the author responds to the viewpoint that later school start times would create logistical problems?",

Supporters believe that mandatory service teaches students the value of giving back to their communities and helps them develop important life skills. Opponents argue that forcing students to volunteer defeats the purpose of service and turns it into just another requirement to check off a list. While this concern about authenticity is understandable, it overlooks an important reality: many students who initially resist mandatory service end up discovering meaningful causes they would never have encountered otherwise.

    "question": "Read the passage below and answer the question that follows.\n\nShould Middle Schools Start Later in the Morning?\n\nMany parents and educators argue that middle schools should start later in the morning to improve student outcomes. Proponents of later start times point to research showing that adolescents experience a biological shift in their sleep cycles during puberty, making it difficult for them to fall asleep before 11 p.m. Despite this shift, most middle schools begin classes around 7:30 a.m., meaning students must wake up as early as 6 a.m. to get ready and catch the bus. Studies from the Centers for Disease Control indicate that when schools shift start times to 8:30 a.m. or later, students get more sleep, show improved attendance, and perform better academically. Additionally, the American Academy of Pediatrics has officially recommended that middle and high schools start no earlier than 8:30 a.m.\n\nHowever, critics argue that changing school start times would create significant logistical challenges. They point out that many school districts use the same buses for elementary, middle, and high schools, running multiple routes in sequence. If middle schools started later, either the district would need to purchase more buses—an expensive proposition—or elementary schools would have to start earlier, which could inconvenience working parents. In one survey, 62% of parents opposed changing start times because it would disrupt their morning routines.\n\nFurthermore, supporters of later start times cite a study from a school district in California that showed improved test scores after implementing later start times. They also note that famous tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has expressed support for later school start times on social media, calling early start times 'outdated.' Finally, research shows that students who eat breakfast perform better in school, and later start times would give students more time to eat breakfast at home.\n\nWhile the debate continues, the evidence suggests that later start times benefit students' health and academic performance.\n\nWhich statement most accurately evaluates the quality of the argument's reasoning and evidence?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The argument's reasoning is sound overall, but it includes irrelevant evidence when it cites a celebrity's social media opinion, which does not substantively support the claim about student health outcomes.",

Schools should start later in the morning to better align with teenagers' natural sleep cycles and improve their academic performance.\n\nScientific studies confirm that teenagers' biological clocks are naturally set to stay up later and wake up later. Dr. Mary Carskadon, a sleep researcher at Brown University, found that during puberty, adolescents experience a shift in their circadian rhythm that makes it difficult for them to fall asleep before 11 p.m. When schools require students to be in class by 7:30 a.m., these students are often sleep-deprived.\n\nLater start times have also been shown to improve academic outcomes. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that schools that shifted their start times to 8:30 a.m. or later saw improvements in attendance, alertness, and test scores. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that middle and high schools start no earlier than 8:30 a.m.\n\nFinally, the school bus driver on Route 12 has noticed that students seem groggy in the early morning. She has driven this route for fifteen years and can tell when students haven't had enough sleep.

    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The passage of time reveals that memory is more complex than any mechanical measurement.",

      "C": "Clocks and machines will always outlast the people who create them.",
      "D": "Moving forward in life requires leaving all past memories behind."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because the poem contrasts the clock's 'patient, measured strokes' with the daughter's understanding that memory 'is not so kind'—some moments 'cling like rust' while others 'leave everything behind.' This contrast develops the theme that human memory operates differently from and more complexly than mechanical timekeeping.",

Its windows, clouded with decades of dust, no longer reflected the world outside. The garden had surrendered to wildness years ago, and now only stubborn weeds pushed through the cracks in the walkway. Maya paused at the gate, her grandmother's key heavy in her pocket. She had promised to retrieve the family album before the estate sale, but as she looked at the weathered porch steps, she wondered if some memories were better left undisturbed.\n\nWhich choice best describes what the passage reveals about Maya's attitude toward entering the house?",

      "D": "She feels confident and determined to complete her task quickly"
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because the passage reveals Maya's reluctance through multiple textual details: she 'paused at the gate' rather than proceeding directly inside, the key feels 'heavy' in her pocket (suggesting the emotional weight of the task), and she wonders 'if some memories were better left undisturbed,' which clearly shows her uncertainty and hesitation about confronting what lies within the house.",

For weeks, she practiced in front of her mirror, then her family, and finally a few friends. On presentation day, her hands shook as she walked to the front of the room. But as she began speaking about her topic—rescuing shelter animals—she forgot her fear. She realized that when she focused on something she cared about, her nervousness faded.

Instead, her coach reminded her that running was about personal growth, not just medals. Elena started arriving early to practice and staying late, pushing herself harder than ever.

      "B": "The director stays faithful to the text because Mara is still afraid and still determined, so adding dialogue does not change the meaning of the scene or her character.",
      "C": "The director's departure is necessary because film cannot convey a character's thoughts without dialogue, so any adaptation must add spoken words to represent narration.",
      "D": "The director improves upon the text by making Mara more relatable, since modern audiences prefer characters who express their emotions openly rather than suffering in silence."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because it accurately identifies the specific departure from the text (Mara vocalizes her defiance instead of remaining silent), explains the director's likely artistic reason for this choice (making internal conflict visible in a visual medium), and evaluates the consequence of this decision (it shifts the nature of Mara's strength from quiet resilience to vocal confrontation). This response demonstrates the analytical skill of weighing both the practical demands of adaptation and the thematic implications of changes to the source material.",

Which choice best evaluates the extent to which this production stays faithful to or departs from the original script?",
    "answer": "B",

      "A": "The production completely departs from the script because the setting and costumes are entirely different from what Shakespeare wrote.",
      "B": "The production stays faithful to the script's dialogue but departs in its visual interpretation, allowing the director to explore how the themes remain relevant in a modern context.",
      "C": "The production is unfaithful because changing the setting to New York City removes the feud between the families that is central to the plot.",
      "D": "The production stays entirely faithful because the actors speak the original lines, and setting changes are merely cosmetic."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because it accurately analyzes both the faithful elements (the original dialogue is preserved) and the departures (setting and costumes), while evaluating the director's purpose in making these choices. The explanation connects the modern setting to the exploration of timeless themes, demonstrating an understanding of how a production can be partially faithful while making meaningful interpretive departures.",

    "question": "A contemporary young adult novel features Marcus, a teenager who faces three tests of his character: he is offered academic success through cheating, social popularity through betraying a friend, and wealth through lying on a scholarship application. He refuses each temptation and, though he initially struggles with lower grades and social isolation, eventually earns respect and success through honest effort. This storyline draws on the biblical story of Jesus's three temptations in the wilderness, where Jesus refuses Satan's offers of power, safety, and wealth, and emerges with divine approval. Which choice best explains how the modern novel renders this traditional pattern new?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "By transforming a divine test of spiritual loyalty into a human test of integrity with realistic consequences rather than immediate divine approval",
      "B": "By maintaining the same spiritual framework but updating the setting to a modern school environment",
      "C": "By changing the temptations to focus exclusively on financial gain rather than power or status",
      "D": "By having the protagonist avoid all negative consequences through his virtuous choices"
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because the novel transforms the biblical pattern in two key ways: first, it shifts the context from a divine test of Jesus's spiritual loyalty to Satan into a human test of Marcus's integrity in realistic social situations; second, it replaces the immediate divine approval Jesus receives with realistic consequences—Marcus initially struggles before eventually earning success through honest effort. This demonstrates how the modern work renders the traditional material new by adapting both the character type (from divine figure to ordinary teenager) and the resolution pattern (from divine reward to earned human consequences).",

By twenty-three, she was a media darling, hailed as the next visionary of tech. Investors threw money at her, and she began to believe the headlines that called her unstoppable. She ignored the warnings of mentors who told her to slow down, to build a foundation before expanding further. 'I know what I'm doing,' she said, launching three new products in a single quarter. Within months, the company collapsed under its own weight, and Maya watched from the sidelines as others picked up the pieces she had left behind.\"\n\nThe story of Icarus from Greek mythology tells of a boy who, given wings made of feathers and wax, flew too close to the sun despite his father's warnings. The wax melted, and he fell into the sea.\n\nWhich choice best describes how this modern story transforms the traditional myth?",

      "C": "The detail about when the cafeteria was renovated",
      "D": "The students' environmental concerns about meat production"

    "answer_explanation": "Option C is correct because the detail about when the cafeteria was renovated three years ago has no logical connection to the argument that the school should offer more vegetarian options. The renovation date does not support any claim about student preferences, costs, or environmental impact, making it irrelevant evidence.

A similar shopping center in the neighboring town created 200 jobs last year. Also, shopping centers are popular across the country, and our town's current unemployment rate is only 3%, which is below the national average.

    "question": "Read the following excerpt from an argumentative essay:\n\n\"Schools should start no earlier than 8:30 a.m. to better support student health and academic success. Research shows that teenagers' biological clocks naturally shift during adolescence, making it difficult to fall asleep before 11 p.m. When schools require students to arrive by 7:30 a.m., many teens get fewer than seven hours of sleep—far below the recommended nine hours. Studies from districts that implemented later start times report improved attendance, reduced tardiness, and higher test scores.

Research shows that teens who spend more than three hours daily on screens often experience disrupted sleep patterns, as the blue light from devices interferes with the body's natural sleep cycle.
