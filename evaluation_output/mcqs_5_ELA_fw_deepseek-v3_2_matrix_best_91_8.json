Before this, books were painstakingly copied by hand, making them rare and expensive. The printing press allowed for the mass production of texts, which dramatically lowered costs and increased availability. This technological breakthrough facilitated the rapid spread of new ideas during the Renaissance and the Reformation.

They were built with multiple layers of stone and gravel for durability, allowing armies and trade goods to move quickly across the empire. The second type, called viae vicinales, were smaller local roads that linked villages, farms, and mines to the main highways.

      "A": "Watt's refinement directly led to the invention of railroads.",
      "B": "Watt's refinement made factories more efficient, which reduced the need for railroads.",

      "D": "Watt's refinement was unrelated to railroad development; railroads were invented separately."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option C is correct because the passage states that Watt's refinement allowed factories to be built away from water sources, leading to urban growth. This growth increased demand for raw materials, which in turn spurred innovations in transportation, including the development of railroads. This shows a causal interaction between the steam engine improvement and railroad development based on specific information in the text.",

The leaves, once vibrant, now rustle and descend to the earth, their fall a silent testament to the inevitable.

    "question": "Read the following passage. Leo was known as the best artist in fifth grade. He had won every art contest since kindergarten. When a new student, Mia, entered the school and won the spring art contest with a simple drawing of her garden, Leo felt a sharp pang of jealousy. He watched Mia spend her recesses sketching quietly, her face lit with concentration. One day, Leo asked her why she drew so much. Mia smiled and said, 'I draw because it makes me happy, not to win.' Leo thought about his own drawings, how he always chose flashy subjects to impress the judges. He started drawing things he loved, like his dog sleeping or the old oak tree. He didn't win the next contest, but for the first time, he didn't care. He felt a deep contentment just from creating.

This character response supports the theme that personal fulfillment arises from internal enjoyment rather than external rewards.",

Leo is cautious and methodical: he studies maps, packs a first-aid kit, and always tells an adult exactly where he is going. He prefers to follow marked trails and keeps a detailed journal of every plant and animal he sees. Mia is more impulsive and adventurous. She loves to discover new paths, often wandering off without a plan, and she remembers landmarks by feeling—like the rough bark of an old oak or the coolness of a hidden spring.
