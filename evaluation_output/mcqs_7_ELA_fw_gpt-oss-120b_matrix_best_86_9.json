In the first section, the author describes how digital libraries and online tutorials give learners immediate access to a wealth of information that was once confined to the shelves of a few schools. This unprecedented access empowers students to explore subjects beyond the curriculum and to learn at their own pace. However, as the article progresses, the focus shifts to the downside of this digital revolution. By the third paragraph, the author points out that constant reliance on search engines and ready‑made answers can erode students' ability to think critically and solve problems without assistance. Teachers report that pupils often accept the first answer they find online without questioning its validity. In the final section, the author calls for a balanced approach, suggesting that while technology should be integrated into classrooms, educators must also teach students how to evaluate sources and develop independent reasoning skills.\"\n\nWhich choice best identifies the two central ideas of the passage and explains how they develop over the course of the text?",

    "question": "Read the passage below:\n\nIn recent decades, the push for renewable energy has grown alongside concerns about climate change. Solar and wind power have become more affordable, leading many countries to invest heavily in clean technologies. However, the transition is not without challenges. Energy storage remains costly, and the intermittent nature of solar and wind can cause supply gaps. At the same time, conservation efforts, such as protecting forests and wetlands, play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions. These natural solutions complement technological advances, as healthy ecosystems can absorb CO2 while renewable infrastructure expands. The author argues that a combined approach—investing in renewable energy while preserving natural habitats—is essential for a sustainable future.\n\nWhich choice best identifies the two central ideas of the passage and explains how the author develops them throughout the text?",

    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Renewable energy is the only solution to climate change, and the author supports this by listing various clean technologies.",
      "B": "Both renewable energy development and natural conservation are essential, and the author develops this by presenting their benefits and challenges.",
      "C": "The passage focuses on the high cost of energy storage and suggests abandoning renewable sources.",

Maya, a high school senior, organized a neighborhood clean‑up and urged residents to plant native trees along the banks. She believed that restoring the river's natural floodplain would reduce future flooding.

The loss of ice not only raises sea levels but also disrupts the habitats of polar bears and indigenous communities reliant on hunting. Scientists argue that immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are essential to halt this trend.\"\n\nExcerpt B (Author B): \"While Arctic sea ice has indeed diminished, some researchers point out that natural climate cycles have historically caused fluctuations in ice extent. They suggest that the current decline, though concerning, may be part of a longer‑term pattern and that adaptation strategies, such as building resilient coastal infrastructure, should be prioritized over rapid emission cuts.\"\n\nWhich choice best describes how the two authors shape their presentations of the key information about Arctic sea‑ice decline?",

    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The author adds a female companion, Martha, who assists Revere, a detail not found in the historical record.",

      "D": "The author omits the warning about the British entirely, focusing instead on a battle scene."

    "question": "Read the excerpt below.\n\n\"Many students think that playing video games makes them less focused in school. However, a recent study of 200 middle‑school students found that those who played video games for less than an hour each day had higher test scores than those who did not play at all. This shows that limited video game play can improve focus.\"\n\nWhich choice best evaluates the claim that limited video game play can improve focus?",
    "answer": "D",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The claim is well supported because the study shows higher test scores for limited players.",

      "C": "The claim is unsupported because the passage provides no evidence at all.",
      "D": "The claim is partially supported because the study only measures test scores, not direct evidence of focus."

The school cafeteria reports that 60% of students now eat meals they prepared themselves, compared to only 30% five years ago. The principal argues that this shift is beneficial because it reduces cafeteria waste and saves the school money on food costs. However, the only data presented are the percentages of students bringing lunch; no information is given about the actual amount of waste reduced or the cost savings achieved.\"\n\nWhich choice best evaluates the principal's claim that the shift is beneficial, assessing whether the reasoning is sound and the evidence is sufficient?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The principal's claim is not adequately supported; the only evidence presented is the increase in students bringing lunch, which does not directly demonstrate reduced waste or cost savings, so the reasoning is unsound.",
      "B": "The principal's claim is strongly supported; the increase from 30% to 60% of students bringing lunch clearly proves that waste has been cut and the school is saving money.",
      "C": "The principal's claim is partially supported; the rise in students bringing lunch suggests a possible benefit, but without specific data on waste reduction and cost, the evidence is insufficient to confirm the claim.",
      "D": "The principal's claim is irrelevant to the issue; the passage focuses on student nutrition, not on waste or cost, so the claim should be ignored."
