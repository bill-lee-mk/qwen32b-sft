Yesterday, I _____ to school.” Options: A) walk, B) walked, C) will walk, D) walking. Metadata shows correct answer B with rationale.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (STRUCTURED):\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key B matches options and explanation correctly identifies ‘yesterday’ → past tense ‘walked’. No mismatches.\n- Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): Practice/assessment item; no visible answer in student-facing content. Answer/explanation only in metadata → not a giveaway.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus present → N/A, pass.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Wording is clear and error-free. No merged words or stray symbols.\nResult: No issues identified across any metrics.\n\nStep 3 – Metric Scoring: With zero issues, all binary metrics = 1.0.\n\nStep 4 – Overall Score per deterministic rules: C=0 (no critical fails), N=0 (no non-critical fails) ⇒ overall must be in 0.85–1.0. Item is clean and well-aligned; select 0.96 (Acceptable, high). Suggestions provided for potential polish.\n\nC. Deviation Justification: None needed; used provided context. Scenario 3 applied for difficulty due to absent definitions.\n\nCurriculum Data Validation Checklist:\n- Standard Identification: Yes (CCSS L.1.1.E), Confidence SOFT\n- Difficulty Definitions: No → Scenario 3 documented\n- Assessment Boundaries: No → documented\n- Learning Objectives: No explicit; inferred and aligned\n- Common Misconceptions: No explicit; evaluated based on general pedagogy\n- Requested Format Type: Specified MCQ and validated (4 options present)\n- Item Specifications: None provided → spec_compliance passes by default\n- Data Sources: Student-facing content + metadata used appropriately",

Use standards as guidance; be conservative about spec enforcement.\n- Standard Identification: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.1.1.F – Use frequently occurring adjectives.\n- Difficulty Definitions: None provided in curriculum context (“<unspecified>”). Scenario 3 applies: No Difficulty Definition provided - using Scenario 3 assessment. I define difficulty levels for Grade 1 adjectives as:\n  • Easy: Choose a common adjective that clearly fits a concrete context with strong cues.\n  • Medium: Distinguish between multiple plausible adjectives requiring attention to nuance.\n  • Hard: Ambiguous context, less frequent adjectives, or multi-step inference across clauses.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided. Document: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n- Learning Objectives: None explicitly provided beyond standard description; inferred objective: select an appropriate common adjective to complete a sentence.\n- Common Misconceptions: None provided. Use general pedagogy: students may choose adjectives that are true descriptors but do not fit the context need (e.g., length vs warmth), or choose antonyms (light/thin) that contradict context.\n- Item Specifications: None provided; only generation prompt indicates MCQ type.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Correct answer A (“heavy”) matches options and rationale.

No answer revealed pre-attempt; no giveaway.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus; N/A and pass.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Wording clear, no typos or merged words. Capitalized “BEST” is fine for emphasis.\nNo issues identified. Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nAdditional metric-by-metric notes:\n- Factual Accuracy: Explanation is accurate; heavy coats are associated with thickness/insulation.\n- Educational Accuracy: Cleanly targets selecting an adjective that fits context.\n- Curriculum Alignment: Directly aligns with L.1.1.F using frequent adjectives (heavy, light, thin, short).\n- Clarity & Precision: Clear task: choose the best adjective to fit the sentence about freezing wind.\n- Specification Compliance: Request type was MCQ; content includes 4 options; compliant. No additional item specs to enforce.\n- Reveals Misconceptions & Distractor Quality: Distractors are plausible: “light”/“thin” are contextually incorrect due to warmth; “short” is orthogonal (length vs warmth). Good diagnostic value.\n- Difficulty Alignment: For Grade 1, this appears Easy-to-Medium under Scenario 3 bar. Since no authoritative difficulty spec is provided and grade-level appropriateness is good, difficulty_alignment passes.\n- Passage Reference: None needed.\n- Stimulus Quality: None present; pass.\n- Mastery Learning: Requires applying context clues to select a semantically appropriate adjective; not pure recall.\n\nDeterministic Overall Scoring: No critical or non-critical metric failures (C=0, N=0) → overall must be in [0.85, 1.0].

Using Scenario 3 assessment: define Medium as requiring application of knowledge beyond pure recall, distinguishing among multiple plausible prepositions by meaning.\n\nAssessment Boundaries: None provided. Documented: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n\nLearning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Students choose an appropriate preposition (direction/place/time) to complete a sentence.\n\nCommon Misconceptions: Not provided. Inferred likely misconceptions: confusing temporal vs spatial prepositions (e.g., “during” vs a place/direction preposition), overextending spatial prepositions like “under,” or misusing “beyond” for goal-directed motion.\n\nItem Specifications: None provided. Requested format/type from generation metadata: type = mcq. Verification: answer_options populated with 4 choices; matches MCQ.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\n- Step 1 (Intent): This is a standalone MCQ practice/assessment item; no worked-example framing. Student-facing content: stem and four options only. Explanation resides in metadata (post-attempt), not a giveaway.\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Explanation says Option A “toward” is correct; this matches the labeled correct answer and available options. No mismatches.\n- Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): No pre-attempt answer given. No reveal cues needed; nothing in stem reveals the answer.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus; N/A.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Wording is clear and age-appropriate. No merged words or confusing symbols. The blank (_____ ) clearly indicates a missing word.\n\nIssues Identified (Step 2): No issues identified. Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nMetric Rationales:\n- Factual Accuracy: “toward” correctly fits the directional meaning; other options are real prepositions but semantically unsuitable here. Metadata aligns.\n- Educational Accuracy: Assesses intended skill (choosing appropriate preposition) without giveaways.\n- Curriculum Alignment: Directly aligns with L.1.1.I using common prepositions (examples include during, beyond, toward).\n- Clarity & Precision: Task and expectations are unambiguous.\n- Specification Compliance: No explicit specs; format matches requested MCQ.\n- Reveals Misconceptions: Distractors map to common errors (temporal vs locational/directional misuse, overgeneralizing spatial relations).\n- Difficulty Alignment: For Grade 1, selecting among plausible prepositions using sentence context is an appropriate medium challenge; labeled difficulty “medium” is reasonable.\n- Passage Reference: N/A (no passage).\n- Distractor Quality: All single-word prepositions; grammatically parallel; plausible for novices; balanced length; not obviously telegraphing the answer.\n- Stimulus Quality: N/A (no image).\n- Mastery Learning: Requires applying semantic knowledge of prepositions, not mere recall.\n- Localization: Neutral, age-appropriate context; no cultural sensitivities.\n\nOverall score selection: With C=0 and N=0, range is 0.85–1.0.

A student could interpret the task as (a) look for commas in dates/series, or (b) pick the option announcing itself as correct, which changes the expected answer process.\nISSUE4 (Curriculum Alignment): The content does not present sentences with dates or series, so it is not aligned to CCSS L.1.2.C.\nISSUE5 (Reveals Misconceptions): Distractors are generic (\"An incorrect distractor.\") and do not reflect plausible Grade 1 comma-usage errors.\nISSUE6 (Difficulty Alignment): Labeled \"hard\" but contains no substantive content or cognitive demand; does not meet a reasonable bar for hard items for this standard.\nISSUE7 (Distractor Quality): The correct choice is telegraphed by meta-labeling (\"The correct choice...\"); other options are obviously incorrect by labeling, leading to poor plausibility and non-parallelism of meaning.\nISSUE8 (Mastery Learning Alignment): No application of comma rules; success requires no reasoning beyond noticing meta-labeling.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Mismatch – explanation claims alignment to the standard, but options contain no examples of commas in dates/series.\nChecklist B1 (Answer Giveaway – practice/assessment): This is a standalone MCQ (practice/assessment). The correct answer is trivially indicated by the wording \"The correct choice that matches the standard.\" in Option A (pre-attempt), constituting a giveaway (handled under Educational Accuracy, not as a separate stimulus issue).\nChecklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus; N/A, pass.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No typos, but jargon and meta-labeling create clarity problems (handled above).\n\nScoring Mechanics:\n- Critical metric failures: factual_accuracy = 0.0; educational_accuracy = 0.0 (C=2).\n- Non-critical metric failures: curriculum_alignment, clarity_precision, reveals_misconceptions, difficulty_alignment, distractor_quality, mastery_learning_alignment (N=6).\nPer rules, overall must be 0.0–0.65.

Also, referencing a standard code is far beyond Grade 1 expectations and unrelated to the skill’s difficulty.\nISSUE6 (mastery_learning_alignment): No reasoning or application is required; success comes from reading the meta-labeled correct option.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key A matches options; explanation references A consistently. No mismatches.\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway Check): This is a practice/assessment-style MCQ; the correct option is explicitly labeled in student-facing text (Option A text). Clear giveaway → educational_accuracy issue.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No merged non-words or confusing symbols; language is meta-level but grammatically fine.\n\nDeterministic Scoring Mechanics: Critical fails: educational_accuracy=0.0 (C=1). Non-critical fails: curriculum_alignment, distractor_quality, reveals_misconceptions, difficulty_alignment, mastery_learning_alignment (N=5). Overall must be in 0.55–0.75; choose lower half (0.60) due to one critical fail and multiple non-critical fails.\n\nDeviation Justification: None—no Curriculum API specs/difficulties provided; applied Scenario 3 as required.",

Ensure the correct option is not labeled as correct in its text.\n- Craft plausible distractors reflecting real misconceptions (e.g., missing a vowel sound, using ‘ch’ vs ‘sh’, omitting a consonant).\n- Align difficulty by using trickier sound patterns (digraphs/blends) while staying Grade 1 appropriate."

Using Scenario 3: formulate own difficulty bar. For Grade 1 L.1.5.B, “Medium” would typically require selecting a definition that includes both a correct category and at least one accurate attribute from among plausible near-misses (e.g., only attribute, only category, wrong attribute), not trivial giveaways.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided.\n- Learning Objectives: Not provided. Inferred objective: Students identify or produce definitions that include category + attribute(s) for a given noun (e.g., “A duck is a bird that swims”).\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided. Inferred typical misconceptions: providing only a category (too vague), providing only an attribute (missing category), confusing categories (e.g., calling a duck a fish), using non-key/irrelevant attributes.\n- Item Specifications: None provided.\n\nRequested Format Type (Generation Prompt):\n- Request specifies type: \"mcq\". The item includes 4 populated answer_options, so format-type validation passes.\n\nStep 1 – Intent:\n- This is a practice/assessment-style MCQ (no instructional walkthrough; answer key present as metadata). Thus pre-attempt content must not give away the answer.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (Committed):\nISSUE1 (educational_accuracy): Option A text explicitly signals correctness: \"The correct choice that matches the standard.\" This trivially reveals the answer pre-attempt for a practice/assessment item.\nISSUE2 (curriculum_alignment): Stem \"Which choice best demonstrates the skill described in L.1.5.B at medium difficulty?\" and options are meta-labels; no vocabulary/category/attribute content is assessed. Misaligned with L.1.5.B.\nISSUE3 (clarity_precision): The stem references the standard code (\"L.1.5.B\") and \"medium difficulty\"—teacher-facing meta not understandable to Grade 1 students; unclear what action/knowledge is required beyond selecting a meta-labeled option.\nISSUE4 (distractor_quality): Choices B–D are \"An incorrect distractor.\"/\"Another incorrect distractor.\" They are obviously implausible and self-identify as wrong; A self-identifies as correct; violates plausibility and telegraphs the answer.\nISSUE5 (reveals_misconceptions): Distractors do not represent plausible misconceptions tied to L.1.5.B (e.g., category-only, attribute-only, wrong category). They provide no diagnostic value.\nISSUE6 (difficulty_alignment): Labeled \"medium\" but cognitive demand is effectively zero (answer giveaway; no content to analyze), far below a reasonable \"medium\" bar for Grade 1 on this standard.\nISSUE7 (mastery_learning_alignment): No reasoning or application required; purely meta selection; zero diagnostic value.\n\nChecklist A: Field Consistency Check\n- Labeled correct answer: A. Explanation says A matches the standard. Options include A–D. No cross-field mismatches. Pass for factual accuracy.\n\nChecklist B: Answer Giveaway Check (practice/assessment)\n- Pre-attempt student-facing text includes option A that states it is correct. Trivial giveaway → educational_accuracy failure (ISSUE1).\n\nChecklist C: Diction/Typo Check\n- No typos/merged non-words, but semantic clarity issue already captured in ISSUE3.\n\nScoring Logic:\n- Critical metrics failed: educational_accuracy (C=1)\n- Non-critical failed: curriculum_alignment, clarity_precision, reveals_misconceptions, difficulty_alignment, distractor_quality, mastery_learning_alignment (N=6 ≥3)\n- Overall constrained to 0.55–0.75; chosen 0.58 (lower half due to critical fail plus multiple non-critical fails).\n",

Scenario 3 applies: using general grade-level expectations. For Grade 1, selecting an adjective of greater intensity than “large” (choosing “gigantic”) is reasonable as Medium: requires understanding of nuance beyond simple antonyms and familiarity with the word “gigantic,” which is commonly taught alongside “large.”\n\nAssessment Boundaries: None provided. Documented as “No Assessment Boundaries provided.”\n\nLearning Objectives: Not provided. Inferred objective: Students distinguish shades of meaning among adjectives differing in intensity by choosing the more intense synonym.\n\nCommon Misconceptions: Not provided. General pedagogy: Students might confuse synonyms and antonyms (choose “small”/“little”) or choose the base adjective itself (“large”). Distractors reflect these likely errors.\n\nItem Specifications: None provided. Generation prompt specifies type: mcq. Validation: answer_options populated with 4 choices; matches requested format.\n\nStep 1 (Intent): This is a standalone practice/assessment MCQ. No worked-example framing.

Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nMetric scoring rationale:\n- Factual Accuracy: The linguistic claims are correct; “gigantic” is more intense than “large.” Keys and explanations align.\n- Educational Accuracy: Directly assesses shades of meaning in adjectives at Grade 1; no giveaway.\n- Curriculum Alignment: Precisely matches L.1.5.D example (large → gigantic). No boundaries to violate.\n- Clarity & Precision: Unambiguous prompt; action required is clear.\n- Specification Compliance: No explicit spec constraints; requested MCQ format satisfied.\n- Reveals Misconceptions: Distractors plausible: “small”/“little” (antonyms) and “large” (same intensity) reveal misunderstandings.\n- Difficulty Alignment: Suitable as Medium under Scenario 3.\n- Passage Reference: N/A; self-contained.\n- Distractor Quality: Parallel, plausible, homogeneous; no length or specificity giveaways beyond content knowledge.\n- Stimulus Quality: No stimulus; no harm.\n- Mastery Learning: Requires applying concept of intensity, not mere recall of a single fact; diagnostic value present.\n- Localization: Neutral, age-appropriate US English.\n\nOverall score selection: C=0, N=0 ⇒ allowable range 0.85–1.0.

Scenario 3 applies: No Difficulty Definition provided - using own difficulty assessment for Grade 1 conjunction usage.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided. Thus, no boundary enforcement required.\n- Learning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Use common conjunctions to signal simple relationships (cause/effect signaled by “because”).\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided. General pedagogical knowledge used: 1st graders may confuse conjunction roles, selecting “and/but/or” instead of “because” for causal relationships.\n- Item Specifications: None provided. No enforceable format constraints beyond generation prompt.\n- Requested Format Type (Generation Prompt): type = “mcq”. Verified: Content includes 4 populated answer options (A–D). Matches requested format.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\nStep 1 – Question Type: Standalone MCQ practice/assessment item (no instructional walkthrough or reveal cues). \n\nStep 2 – Issues (Committed Before Scoring):\n- ISSUE1 (difficulty_alignment): Stem: “We stayed inside during recess ______ it was too cold to play outside. Which choice best completes the sentence to show the reason why?” Labeled difficulty = “hard”, but the task is straightforward for Grade 1 with an explicit cue (“show the reason why”), and only one conjunction (“because”) fits the causal relationship.

No mismatches found.\nChecklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): No visible giveaway in student-facing text; explanation is metadata only. Pass.\nChecklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus present. N/A.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No typos or merged non-words.

This item introduces an exception (‘have’ is short a despite final e), increasing complexity. That makes it appropriately challenging—consistent with a “hard” label within Grade 1 for this standard.\n\nD.

Explanation consistent.\n- Educational Accuracy: Assesses distinguishing long vs short vowel sounds; appropriate for Grade 1 RF.1.2.A. No pre-attempt giveaways.\n- Curriculum Alignment: Matches RF.1.2.A intent. Although the standard says “spoken,” using printed words is common; students can read/say aloud. Suggestion noted to strengthen alignment (audio cue or specify “short a sound”).\n- Other metrics (clarity, distractors, mastery, etc.) evaluated using the student-facing content provided.\n\nConclusion: No concrete issues.

This ambiguity changes how a student might respond.\nISSUE4 (reveals_misconceptions): Distractors are generic and implausible (e.g., “An incorrect distractor.” “Another incorrect distractor.”). They do not reflect likely miscounts of syllables or related misconceptions.\nISSUE5 (difficulty_alignment): Labeled difficulty is “hard,” but due to the giveaway and lack of any phonics task, the cognitive demand is below grade-level expectations and certainly not “hard.” Scenario 3 applied.\nISSUE6 (distractor_quality): Choices are not plausible or diagnostic; the correct answer is self-referential and telegraphed. The others are explicitly labeled “incorrect,” violating plausibility and balance.\nISSUE7 (mastery_learning_alignment): The item requires no application of the target skill; students can simply pick the option labeled as correct. Purely trivial; no diagnostic value.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency Check): The labeled correct answer (A) matches the explanation provided; no cross-field mismatches. Pass.\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway Check): This is a practice/assessment item. Pre-attempt text includes “The correct choice that matches the standard.” → explicit giveaway. Fail recorded under educational_accuracy.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo Check): No merged non-words or stray symbols; language is meta-level and inappropriate for Grade 1, but not typographically erroneous. Diction concerns are addressed under clarity_precision.\n\nC. Deviation Justification: None beyond using Scenario 3 for difficulty due to no provided definitions. All uses of curriculum context documented above.\n\nScoring mechanics: Critical metrics: factual_accuracy=1.0, educational_accuracy=0.0 → C=1. Non-critical failures: curriculum_alignment, clarity_precision, reveals_misconceptions, difficulty_alignment, distractor_quality, mastery_learning_alignment → N=6.

General pedagogy: 1st graders often overgeneralize the silent-e pattern, expecting a long vowel sound (e.g., expecting long /ō/ in “love”).\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Generation prompt requested type=mcq; item contains 4 populated answer choices → conforms.\n\nB. Standard Evaluation Process:\nStep 1 – Student-facing content: Stem: “Which choice is an irregularly spelled word?” Options: A like, B love, C make, D cake. No stimulus.

While “irregularly spelled” is domain terminology, it matches the standard’s language and is commonly taught.\n- Specification Compliance: No explicit item-writing specs; prompt type=mcq matched by 4 options.\n- Reveals Misconceptions: Distractors exemplify regular CVCe long-vowel pattern; likely distracts students who overgeneralize silent-e.\n- Difficulty Alignment: For Grade 1, distinguishing an irregular word among regular silent-e words without picture support is reasonable as Medium-to-Hard.

Inferred objective: With support, read an informational text and identify the next event/detail from the text.\n\nCommon Misconceptions: None provided.

For Grade 1, the intent seems to be the immediate next step. The lack of \"right after\" or \"next\" could lead to multiple plausible answers.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Correct answer B matches the passage and the explanation quotes the correct sentence. No mismatches.\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway): No pre-attempt giveaways; answer key appears only in metadata. No stimulus issues.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No errors found.\n\nMetric scoring mapping: Only clarity_precision has a concrete issue. All other metrics pass.

Using Scenario 3: self-assess difficulty appropriateness based on grade-level norms.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided.

Also check generation prompt format: requested type \"mcq\"—options are populated (4 choices), so compliant.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (STRUCTURED):\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): The explanation states B is correct because the sentence says the nest is “very small,” which matches the provided sentence and options. No mismatches.\n- Checklist B1 (Answer giveaway pre-attempt): None; rationale is metadata and not student-facing pre-attempt.

Generation prompt requests MCQ; item includes 4 options → compliant.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- No issues identified.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency):\n- Correct answer labeled B matches the text (“Tom found pretty seashells near the water”). Explanation aligns with options and content. No mismatches found.\n\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway Check):\n- Item is a practice/assessment MCQ. No pre-attempt giveaway in student-facing content. Answer and explanation are metadata-only.\n\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo Check):\n- Clear, age-appropriate language; no typos or merged words. Capitalization of “WORDS” serves emphasis and is not confusing.\n\nMetric Scoring Logic:\n- All metrics pass (no identified issues). Difficulty: while labeled “hard,” the item remains appropriate for Grade 1 and does not constitute a ≥2-grade mismatch, so difficulty_alignment passes.\n\nOverall Score Determination:\n- C=0 (no critical metric failures), N=0 (no non-critical failures) → overall must be in 0.85–1.0. Item is clean and well-aligned; choose 0.96 (acceptable, high quality).",

Confidence level = SOFT (inferred from content metadata provided).\n- Difficulty Definitions: None provided in the curriculum context (all unspecified). Using Scenario 3 assessment: I applied typical grade 1 ELA expectations—identifying a key idea from short informational text; “hard” would typically require synthesizing multiple details and/or integrating an illustration. This item feels easy–medium, but per the Borderline Rule for difficulty_alignment, failing requires ≥2-grade mismatch; not the case here, so difficulty_alignment passes.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided for this standard in the context. Documenting: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n- Learning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: identify a key idea using details from a brief informational text (consistent with RI.1.7’s “details in a text” component).\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided. I used general pedagogical knowledge (students may overfocus on a single detail, confuse stages, or think frogs keep tails).\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Requested format type in generation prompt: mcq.

This is a field consistency mismatch.\n- ISSUE2 (distractor_quality): Snippet: Option A: “Frogs can fly when they grow up.” and Option D: “Frogs never need water.” Problems: A is obviously false/implausible and off-scope for the text; D is absolute and not about growth (the prompt asks for a key idea about how frogs grow). This reduces plausibility, homogeneity, and specificity balance among options.\n- ISSUE3 (reveals_misconceptions): The distractors do not target likely misconceptions about frog growth from the text (e.g., keeping tails, not growing legs). As a result, the item has low diagnostic value for the intended comprehension skill.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Mismatch found (explanation references a picture that is absent) → factual_accuracy issue recorded.\nChecklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): No explicit answer given in student-facing text; no reveal cues present but no giveaway either.\nChecklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No image present; nothing harmful in stimuli.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): Minor grammatical error in stem: “Read the text and.” (incomplete instruction). Does not create multiple interpretations; noted for improvement but not failing clarity.\n\nScoring Mechanics:\n- Critical metric failures: factual_accuracy = 0.0 (C=1)\n- Non-critical metric failures: distractor_quality = 0.0, reveals_misconceptions = 0.0 (N=2)\nOverall score must fall in 0.70–0.84.

Inferred objective: Identify/describe the story setting using key textual details (RL.1.3).\n\nCommon Misconceptions: Not provided.

No explicit numeric or content constraints to enforce.\n- Learning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Students identify behaviors that follow discussion rules (listen carefully, stay on topic, follow teacher directions, speak one at a time). Item aligns with “listening to others with care.”\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided. Using general pedagogy: common off-task or disrespectful behaviors (talking over others, going off-topic, ignoring teacher) are typical pitfalls; distractors reflect these.\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Generation prompt requested type: “mcq.” The item contains 4 populated answer_options, consistent with MCQ.\n\nB. Standard Evaluation Process\nStep 1 – Content & Intent:\n- Student-facing content: Stem: “The class is having a discussion about a story. Which choice shows following the rules for discussions?” Options A–D as provided.\n- Metadata/teacher-only: answer key “B”; answer_explanation.\n- No on-demand hints or post-error feedback indicated.\n- Intent: Practice/assessment MCQ (standalone prompt, no walkthrough).\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- No issues identified.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency):\n- Answer key B matches options and explanation. No mismatches.\n\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway):\n- No student-visible answer giveaway; “answer: B” is metadata only. Pass.\n\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo):\n- Clear, age-appropriate wording. No merged words or confusing symbols.\n\nStep 3 – Metric scoring set below (all pass since no issues).\nStep 4 – Overall per rules: C=0 (no critical fails), N=0 (no non-critical fails) → overall in [0.85,1.0]. Choose 0.95 (high quality, straightforward, aligned, but not exceptional/novel).\n\nC. Deviation Justification: Not applicable; no deviation from provided curriculum context necessary under SOFT confidence.\n",

Confidence: SOFT (inferred).\n- Difficulty Definitions: None provided in curriculum context (all unspecified). Using Scenario 3: own difficulty assessment based on grade-appropriate expectations for SL.1.3.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided.\n- Learning Objectives: Inferred from the standard—students should ask/answer questions about a speaker’s message to clarify or get more info.\n- Common Misconceptions: None provided. Will judge distractors on general pedagogy.\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Requested format in generation prompt: type = \"mcq\". The item includes 4 answer options, so format compliance passes.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\nStep 1: Question intent = Practice/Assessment MCQ. Student-facing content: stem \"Which choice best demonstrates the skill described in SL.1.3 at hard difficulty?\" Options A-D. No stimuli. Metadata includes answer key A.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (committed before scoring):\n- ISSUE1 (educational_accuracy): Giveaway and wrong skill targeting. Snippet: Option A text \"The correct choice that matches the standard.\" This explicitly labels itself as correct, making the task trivial for a practice/assessment item. Also, the item does not actually assess SL.1.3 (no speaker statement, no asking/answering questions about what a speaker says).\n- ISSUE2 (curriculum_alignment): Misaligned with SL.1.3. Snippet: Stem \"Which choice best demonstrates the skill described in SL.1.3...\" with options that are meta-labeled rather than involving asking/answering questions about a speaker’s words. No listening/speaking context or clarification questions are present.\n- ISSUE3 (clarity_precision): Not student-friendly or clear for Grade 1. Snippet: \"...the skill described in SL.1.3 at hard difficulty?\" A typical first grader cannot interpret a standards code or the phrase \"hard difficulty,\" making what to do unclear.\n- ISSUE4 (distractor_quality): Implausible distractors. Snippets: \"An incorrect distractor.\" / \"Another incorrect distractor.\" These are obviously wrong and provide no plausible alternatives.\n- ISSUE5 (reveals_misconceptions): Because distractors are generic and not tied to likely misunderstandings about clarifying a speaker’s message, the item has minimal diagnostic value.\n- ISSUE6 (difficulty_alignment): Labeled difficulty = hard, but the item is trivial due to the self-identifying correct option; also the linguistic demands (standard code) are above grade level while the cognitive demand is near-zero.\n- ISSUE7 (mastery_learning_alignment): Task does not require applying the SL.1.3 skill (no speaker content to query/clarify) and is essentially a superficial selection; thus, poor diagnostic value and minimal reasoning.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key A matches an existing option; explanation refers to A; no cross-field mismatches. Pass.\nChecklist B1 (Answer Giveaway, practice/assessment): Pre-attempt content includes Option A labeled \"The correct choice...\" → explicit giveaway. Fail under educational_accuracy.\nChecklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus. N/A but passes by default.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No typos/merged words, but semantic clarity issue already captured in ISSUE3.\n\nScoring Mechanics: Critical metric failures: educational_accuracy = 0.0. Non-critical failures: curriculum_alignment, clarity_precision, reveals_misconceptions, difficulty_alignment, distractor_quality, mastery_learning_alignment (N=6). According to rules (C=1, N≥3) overall must be 0.55–0.75. Given severity and multiple issues, choose lower half.\n\nDeviation Justification: None needed beyond SOFT confidence noting; misalignment is clear and unambiguous.",
