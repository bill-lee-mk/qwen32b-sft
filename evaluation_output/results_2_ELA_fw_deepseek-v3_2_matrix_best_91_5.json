Curriculum Data Usage Documentation\n- Confidence Level: SOFT (curriculum context inferred)\n- Standard Targeted: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.2.1.A (Use collective nouns)\n- Difficulty Definitions: None provided in context → Scenario 3: using my own grade-appropriate difficulty assessment\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided\n- Learning Objectives: None provided; inferred objective: students recognize/select appropriate collective nouns in context\n- Common Misconceptions: None provided; inferred: students may overgeneralize animal group terms (pack, school, pride) to all animals\n- Item Specifications: None provided\n- Requested Format Type: Prompt requests type=mcq; content includes 4 MC options → compliant\n\nB. Standard Evaluation Process\n- Question intent: Practice/assessment MCQ for Grade 2 ELA (collective nouns)\n- Student-facing content: Stem “Which choice completes the sentence correctly? The farmer saw a ______ of sheep in the field.” Options: flock, pack, school, pride.\n- Answer visibility: The correct answer is only in metadata; no pre-attempt giveaway.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (Committed):\nISSUE1 (Mastery Learning Alignment):\n- Snippet: “Which choice completes the sentence correctly? The farmer saw a ______ of sheep in the field.”\n- Why: Solvable by recalling a single memorized fact (“flock”) without reasoning or application beyond recall. Per rubric, pure recall items fail Mastery Learning Alignment.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key A = flock; explanation matches; no mismatches.\nChecklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): None; no student-visible answer or cues.\nChecklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus included; N/A.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): Clear, age-appropriate wording; no typos.\n\nC. Scoring Rationale by Metric\n- factual_accuracy: “flock” is the correct collective noun for sheep; explanation consistent → 1.0\n- educational_accuracy: Accurately assesses recognition/use of collective nouns for Grade 2; no giveaway → 1.0\n- curriculum_alignment: Directly aligned to L.2.1.A (use collective nouns) → 1.0\n- clarity_precision: Unambiguous, simple language → 1.0\n- specification_compliance: No explicit spec; requested type=mcq satisfied → 1.0\n- reveals_misconceptions: Distractors mirror common confusions (pack/wolves, school/fish, pride/lions) → 1.0\n- difficulty_alignment: With no provided definitions, classify as Easy: single-step recall appropriate for Grade 2 → 1.0\n- passage_reference: No passage required; self-contained → 1.0\n- distractor_quality: Parallel, plausible, concise, homogeneous → 1.0\n- stimulus_quality: No stimulus; no harm → 1.0\n- mastery_learning_alignment: Pure recall of a single fact; fails rubric’s criterion → 0.0\n- localization_quality: Neutral, culturally appropriate classroom context → 1.0\n\nOverall score selection: C=0 (no critical fails), N=1 (one non-critical fail: mastery_learning_alignment). Deterministic range: 0.75–0.84. Chosen 0.82 (upper half) because the single failure is minor and easily addressable by modest redesign (e.g., require application/explanation).",

Using Scenario 3: own assessment based on grade-2 expectations; a “hard” item for L.2.1.E would likely require choosing/adapting adjectives vs adverbs in a less obvious context or revising sentences to fix modifier errors.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided.

Inferred: Identify and use adjectives/adverbs appropriately; choose between them based on what is modified (nouns vs verbs/adjectives/other adverbs).\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided.

The task does not actually assess the intended skill.\n- ISSUE2 (factual_accuracy): The explanation claims “Option A is correct because it matches the skill described in the standard,” yet Option A’s text is merely “The correct choice that matches the standard.” No option content demonstrates the skill; this is an internal contradiction between claim and provided content.\n- ISSUE3 (curriculum_alignment): Despite referencing L.2.1.E, the item does not require choosing or using adjectives/adverbs. Thus, it is misaligned with the referenced standard’s intent.\n- ISSUE4 (clarity_precision): The stem references “L.2.1.E” and “at hard difficulty,” which a 2nd grader would not understand; students cannot know what “the skill” is from the code, making the task unclear.\n- ISSUE5 (reveals_misconceptions): Distractors are placeholders (“An incorrect distractor.”) and do not reflect plausible misconceptions about adjectives/adverbs.\n- ISSUE6 (distractor_quality): Choices explicitly label themselves as “An incorrect distractor.” and “The correct choice…,” breaking plausibility and telegraphing the answer.\n- ISSUE7 (mastery_learning_alignment): The item requires no application or reasoning about modifiers; it cannot distinguish understanding.\n- ISSUE8 (difficulty_alignment): Labeled “hard” but demands no grade-level reasoning; difficulty labeling is inaccurate.\n- ISSUE9 (educational_accuracy – giveaway): Option A states it is “The correct choice…,” trivially revealing the answer in student-facing content.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key says A; explanation cites A; options A–D exist. No field name mismatches, but ISSUE2 addresses substantive contradiction.\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway): Practice/assessment format with no reveal gates. Option A text literally says it’s the correct choice → explicit pre-attempt giveaway (ISSUE9) under educational_accuracy.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No typos, but clarity problem due to cryptic code in stem (ISSUE4).\n\nScoring mechanics: Critical metrics failed: factual_accuracy and educational_accuracy (C=2).

Confidence: SOFT (inferred).\n\nCurriculum Data Usage:\n- Difficulty Definitions: None provided in context (all unspecified) → Scenario 3 applied. For Grade 2 conventions, Easy would be single location (greeting or closing) punctuation; Medium can require identifying correct commas in both greeting and closing; Hard might involve editing multi-line formats or multiple punctuation marks. Item fits Easy–Medium; no ≥2-grade mismatch.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided → cannot enforce; note compliance generally aligns with the standard’s scope (commas after greeting and closing only).\n- Learning Objectives: Not provided; inferred LO: “Use commas after the greeting and closing of a letter.” Item aligns.\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided; plausible misconceptions include omitting the comma after greeting/closing. Distractors reflect these.\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Generation prompt/type indicates MCQ; the item includes 4 populated options → compliant with requested format.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\n- Intent: Practice/assessment MCQ. Student-facing content includes stem and 4 options; answer and explanation exist in metadata only (post-attempt). No reveal of correct answer pre-attempt.\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Labeled correct answer A; explanation matches options and rule (“comma after ‘Dear Grandma,’ and after ‘Sincerely,’”). No mismatches.\n- Checklist B (Answer Giveaway): B1 — No explicit answer in student-facing text; rationale only in metadata. B2 — No stimulus present.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Clear, age-appropriate wording; no merged words or confusing symbols.\n\nIssues: None identified. No factual inaccuracies, no clarity problems, no spec violations, appropriate distractors, proper alignment with the stated standard, and suitable difficulty for Grade 2.\n\nDeterministic scoring: C=0 (no failures in factual_accuracy or educational_accuracy).

For Grade 2 L.2.2.E, “Easy” = directly using a simple dictionary entry to confirm correct spelling; “Medium” = interpreting multiple parts of an entry (guide words, multiple forms); “Hard” = resolving homographs or variants across multiple entries.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided. No Assessment Boundaries enforced.\n- Learning Objectives: Not provided. Inferred objective: Students use a dictionary entry to identify correct spelling of a word they misspelled.\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided. General pedagogy applied: Students may omit silent letters, drop final ‘e’, or misapply plural/phonics patterns.\n- Item Specifications: None provided.

Student-facing text: stem and four options. Metadata: correct answer C and explanation.\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key “C” matches option text “knife.” Explanation aligns. No mismatches.\n- Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): Although the stem shows a dictionary entry with the correct spelling (“knife”), this is integral to the skill being assessed—consulting a dictionary to correct spelling. The task remains to apply that reference to select the correct option; thus not an inappropriate giveaway for this standard.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No external stimulus.

No merged non-words or confusing symbols.\n\nNo concrete issues identified.\n\nDifficulty Alignment (Scenario 3): Labeled difficulty: “hard.” By the ad hoc bar above, this item is “easy” for Grade 2 because it involves reading a straightforward dictionary entry and matching spelling. However, the Borderline Resolution Rule for difficulty requires a ≥2 grade-level mismatch to fail; the task is appropriate to Grade 2 and not ≥2 grades off.

Documenting: No Assessment Boundaries available to enforce.\n\nLearning Objectives: Not explicitly provided beyond standard. Inferred objective: Students use a simple dictionary entry to determine the correct meaning/part of speech of a polysemous word from sentence context.\n\nCommon Misconceptions: None provided. General pedagogy: Students may conflate noun vs. verb senses (A vs. B) or choose the more general verb “to place firmly” (D) without attending to growth context; some may recall “plant” as a factory (C).\n\nItem Specifications: None provided. Requested format type (generation prompt): type = mcq. Validation: The item has 4 answer_options (A–D) and a single correct answer key → matches MCQ requirement.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\n- Step 1 (Student-facing content): Dictionary entry listing four senses (two nouns, two verbs) and a sentence: “I will plant a tree in my garden.” Prompt asks which definition is used. Options A–D mirror the listed senses. Clear Grade 2 skill (use dictionary to clarify meaning).\n- Step 2 (Issues):\n  Checklist A (Field Consistency): Labeled correct answer B matches sentence context; explanation matches option text; no mismatches.\n  Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): No pre-attempt giveaway; student must interpret context to choose the correct sense.\n  Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No external image; dictionary entry is accurate and supportive.\n  Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Wording is clear and grammatical. Minor potential for confusion due to numbering (1–4) in the entry vs. lettered options (A–D), but the prompt is standard MCQ; no true ambiguity in task.\n  Result: No issues identified. Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nMetric scoring rationale:\n- Factual Accuracy: Correct answer B is indeed the verb sense “to put seeds or young plants in the ground to grow,” which fits “plant a tree … in my garden.” No contradictions.\n- Educational Accuracy: Directly assesses using a dictionary entry to determine meaning from context. No giveaways.\n- Curriculum Alignment: Strongly aligned to L.2.4.E.\n- Clarity & Precision: Instructions and options are clear; action required is unambiguous.\n- Specification Compliance: No applicable hard spec; MCQ format matches prompt.\n- Reveals Misconceptions: Distractors reflect plausible misconceptions (noun vs. verb; alternate verb sense; unrelated ‘factory’ sense).\n- Difficulty Alignment: Appropriate “easy” for Grade 2—single-sentence context, straightforward choice among clearly written senses.\n- Passage Reference: N/A; self-contained.\n- Distractor Quality: Plausible and parallel; none obviously incorrect on surface.\n- Stimulus Quality: Dictionary entry is accurate and helpful.\n- Mastery Learning Alignment: Requires applying context to select correct sense, not mere recall.\n- Localization Quality: Neutral and age-appropriate.\n\nNo deviations from curriculum data necessary beyond noting absence of difficulty definitions and boundaries (Scenario 3).",

Using Scenario 3: No Difficulty Definition provided - using a reasoned difficulty assessment consistent with Grade 2 ELA foundational skills.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided. Therefore, no enforceable boundaries to check.\n- Learning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Students identify base words and common prefixes in grade-appropriate words (e.g., ‘re-’ + base ‘paint’ → ‘repaint’).\n- Common Misconceptions: None provided. Inferred plausible misconceptions for this skill: (a) choosing the prefix (“re”) as the base word, (b) choosing the entire word (“repaint”) as the base, (c) confusing a derivationally related word (“painter”) with the base.\n- Item Specifications: None provided. No prescriptive format requirements to enforce.\n- Requested Format Type (Generation Prompt): type = “mcq”. Verification: The item includes populated answer_options (A–D).

Student-facing content includes: stem “Which choice is the base word in ‘repaint’?” and four options. The answer explanation is presumed post-attempt/help content.\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Labeled correct answer “B” corresponds to option text “paint”. Explanation aligns: “‘paint’ is the base word… The prefix ‘re-’ is added…”. No mismatches.\n- Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway – practice/assessment): No pre-attempt giveaway.

Documenting: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n- Learning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Students answer a “what” question about a key detail explicitly stated in a brief informational text.\n- Common Misconceptions: None provided. Using general pedagogy: Students may confuse different question words (what vs where) and may select a non-matching detail from the passage.\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Documenting: No Item Specifications provided.\n\nRequested Format Type (Generation Prompt):\n- Request specifies type: \"mcq\". Content includes populated answer_options with 4 choices (A–D). This matches the requested format. Count verified: 4 options present.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\n- Step 1 (gather): Student-facing content is a short informational paragraph about Tommy the turtle, followed by the question: \"Which choice tells what Tommy eats?\" with options A–D. No images. Metadata marks correct answer as B and provides rationale consistent with the passage.\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key B corresponds to the sentence \"He eats small plants and insects.\" Options match the explanation. No mismatches.\n- Checklist B (Answer Giveaway): No answer text shown in student-facing stem/options; the correct answer appears only in metadata/explanation. No giveaway before attempt.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Grammar and spelling are correct. Vocabulary is mostly grade-appropriate; any more advanced word (\"sunbathes\") is not needed to answer the question. No merged words or confusing symbols.\n\nStep 2 – Issues: No issues identified. Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nMetric considerations:\n- Factual accuracy: Correct answer (B) matches text. No contradictions.\n- Educational accuracy: Assesses retrieving a key detail (“what” he eats) from an explicit sentence; appropriate for RI.2.1. No giveaway.\n- Curriculum alignment: Directly addresses RI.2.1 by asking a “what” question about key details.\n- Clarity & precision: Prompt is unambiguous about the task. Options are clear.\n- Specification compliance: No explicit item-writing specs given; requested MCQ format satisfied.\n- Reveals misconceptions: Distractors A/C/D are other details from the text (where he lives, where he sunbathes, what he has), aligning with common confusion among question words. Plausible for Grade 2.\n- Difficulty alignment: Labeled \"easy\"; task is direct retrieval of a clearly stated detail, fitting an Easy level for Grade 2 RI.2.1.\n- Passage reference: The question properly references the given mini-passage; answer is locatable.\n- Distractor quality: Choices are plausible and relevant; two are locations (A/C) and one is an attribute (D), which are reasonable traps for mixing up question words. While grammatical forms differ (prepositional vs noun phrases), this is typical and does not telegraph the answer excessively for Grade 2.\n- Stimulus quality: No stimulus included; N/A but passes.\n- Mastery learning: Requires using textual evidence to answer a detail question, not mere background recall.\n- Localization: Neutral, age-appropriate context without cultural sensitivities.\n\nOverall scoring rule application: C=0 (no critical metric failures), N=0 (no non-critical failures) → overall must be in [0.85, 1.0].

Using Scenario 3: own assessment based on typical Grade 2 expectations (sequence/detail comprehension from a short informational passage is Easy–Medium for Grade 2).\n\nAssessment Boundaries: None provided. Cannot enforce; note only.\n\nLearning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: read a brief informational passage and identify a sequenced event (what happens after a described stage), consistent with RI.2 comprehension.\n\nCommon Misconceptions: Not provided. General expectation: students may confuse life cycle sequence steps (egg → caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly) or pick earlier stages.\n\nItem Specifications: None provided. Generation prompt requested type: \"mcq\". The item includes 4 populated options, satisfying the requested format.\n\nQuestion Intent & Display Timing: This is a standalone practice/assessment MCQ. The correct answer and explanation appear only in metadata; nothing in the student-facing stem/options reveals the answer pre-attempt.\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- No issues identified.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Labeled correct answer is C, matching the passage: “After some time, a butterfly comes out of the chrysalis.” Explanation aligns.

No boundaries to enforce.\n- Clarity & Precision: Unambiguous stem and options.\n- Specification Compliance: No hard spec; generation prompt type (mcq) is satisfied.\n- Reveals Misconceptions & Distractor Quality: Distractors are plausible earlier or different stages (A, B, D) that diagnose sequencing confusion.\n- Difficulty Alignment: For Grade 2, task is Easy–Medium; within grade band. Although labeled “hard,” per Scenario 3 and the rule requiring ≥2-grade mismatch to fail, this aligns sufficiently.\n- Passage Reference: Directly references and answerable from the provided passage.\n- Stimulus Quality: Passage is accurate, concise, and supportive.\n- Mastery Learning: Requires evidence-based selection from the passage (sequence comprehension), not rote recall.\n- Localization: Neutral, age-appropriate content.\n\nOverall score computation: C=0 (no failures in factual_accuracy or educational_accuracy), N=0 (no other failures) ⇒ overall must be in 0.85–1.0.

No explicit boundaries to enforce.\n- Learning Objectives: Not provided. Inferred objective: Use sentence context to determine the meaning of a word (burrow) in an informational/literary sentence relevant to animals.\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided.

Then, she remembered her part and continued speaking.\" The correct choice (C) is a direct restatement (stay calm/use cue card). For Grade 2 RL.2.3, this is a straightforward, text-explicit item (our Scenario 3 bar: Easy = direct stated response; Medium = infer response from subtle cues; Hard = integrate multiple events/compare responses or justify with explicit evidence). Therefore, labeled difficulty \"hard\" mismatches the actual cognitive demand (Easy–low Medium).\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Passed. Answer key = C; explanation matches text and options.\nChecklist B1 (Answer Giveaway for practice/assessment): Passed. No pre-attempt giveaway; answer key/explanation are metadata only.\nChecklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): N/A – no image or external stimulus.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): Passed. Clear, age-appropriate wording.\n\nScoring Mechanics:\n- Critical metrics (factual_accuracy, educational_accuracy): both pass (no issues).\n- One non-critical failure: difficulty_alignment.\n- Overall per rules (C=0, N=1) → 0.75–0.84. Chosen 0.83 (upper half) because the single issue is minor and easily fixed (relabel difficulty or increase cognitive demand).\n\nData Source Documentation: Used given item content and request metadata; no conflicting curriculum data to enforce.

Inferred objective: Students describe how repeated lines supply rhythm and meaning in a poem.\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided. Will evaluate distractors based on general pedagogy.\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Generation prompt indicates type=\"mcq\"; content matches (4 options present).\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\n- Step 1 (Intent): This is a standalone multiple-choice practice/assessment item (not a worked example). Answers/explanations appear in metadata (post-attempt), not student-facing.\n\n- Step 2 – Issues (STRUCTURED):\n  • Checklist A (Field Consistency): Options A–D are present and match references. Correct answer labeled B; explanation aligns with option B and stem focus on repetition. No mismatches found.\n  • Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): No student-facing giveaway; correct answer only in metadata. Pass.\n  • Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): Text excerpt accurately includes a repeated line (lines 1 and 3 identical). No contradictions or misleading content. Pass.\n  • Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Clear grammar/spelling. Vocabulary in option B (“constant companionship”) is advanced for Grade 2 but not ambiguous; does not create multiple interpretations. Pass.\n\nNo issues identified. Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nMetric Analyses:\n- Factual Accuracy: The repeated line is correctly identified; option B’s claim (repetition establishes a regular beat reflecting the shadow’s ongoing presence) is accurate. Answer key and explanation are consistent.\n- Educational Accuracy: Directly assesses RL.2.4 by asking how a repeated line supplies rhythm and meaning. No giveaways. Appropriate instructional intent.\n- Curriculum Alignment: Strong alignment with RL.2.4 (regular beats, repeated lines, meaning). No boundaries to enforce.\n- Clarity & Precision: Stem clearly asks about the function of the repeated line. Task is unambiguous. Vocabulary slightly advanced but not confusing.\n- Specification Compliance: No explicit spec to enforce; generation prompt requested MCQ and the item is MCQ with 4 choices.\n- Reveals Misconceptions: Distractors target plausible misunderstandings (e.g., thinking repetition “breaks” rhythm; over-attributing rhyme/funniness; topic change). D is weaker but overall set is diagnostically useful.\n- Difficulty Alignment: Labeled “hard.” For Grade 2, analyzing how repetition contributes to rhythm/meaning and parsing answer choices with higher-level vocabulary is appropriately at the harder end of the spectrum. Scenario 3 justification: “Hard” involves analysis beyond recall and interpreting how form contributes to meaning; this item fits.\n- Passage Reference: Excerpt provided; question references the repeated line explicitly. Self-contained.\n- Distractor Quality: Choices are grammatically parallel and mostly plausible; D is clearly incorrect but serves as a foil. No length or specificity imbalance that telegraphs the answer.\n- Stimulus Quality: Text excerpt is accurate, relevant, and not distracting.\n- Mastery Learning Alignment: Requires application/analysis (linking repetition to rhythm and meaning), not mere recall.\n- Localization Quality: Neutral, age-appropriate content; no cultural sensitivity issues.\n\nDeterministic Overall Scoring: C=0 (no factual/educational failures), N=0 (no other failures).

Documented as: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n- Learning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Students identify a key difference between two well-known versions of Cinderella (Perrault vs Brothers Grimm).\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided.

Using Scenario 3 assessment: define “Hard” at Grade 2 SL.2.5 as requiring nuanced, multi-step reasoning about matching mood with multimodal supports with closely plausible distractors or multiple correct choices requiring best-evidence selection.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided. No boundaries to enforce.\n- Learning Objectives: None explicitly provided. Inferred objective: select an appropriate visual/audio addition to an audio recording of a poem to clarify its mood (peaceful, thoughtful), aligning to SL.2.5.\n- Common Misconceptions: None provided. Used general pedagogy about mood, modality, and multimedia support.\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Requested Format Type (generation prompt) = mcq. Verified content includes 4 answer options, so format matches.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\nStep 1 (Student-facing content): Stem asks which addition best clarifies a peaceful, thoughtful mood in a poem recording. Options: A) drawing of serene forest; B) loud construction noise; C) add sparkly glitter to the paper; D) fast, energetic pace.\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key = A. Explanation supports A and matches options; no mismatches.\n- Checklist B (Answer Giveaway): No pre-attempt giveaways; correct answer only in metadata. No stimulus.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus provided; N/A.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Wording clear. Minor nuance (“add to her recording” could be interpreted as audio-only), but context of SL.2.5 supports adding visual displays alongside audio; not sufficiently ambiguous to change answers → no clarity failure.\n\nIdentified Issue(s):\nISSUE1 (Primary: difficulty_alignment): Labeled difficulty is “hard,” but the task is a straightforward single-step selection with obviously implausible distractors (e.g., loud construction noise, fast energetic pace) for the stated mood. By Scenario 3 criteria, this aligns better with Easy–Medium, not Hard.\n\nScoring Mechanics: Critical metrics (factual_accuracy, educational_accuracy) both pass → C=0. One non-critical failure (difficulty_alignment) → N=1. Overall must be in 0.75–0.84. The single failure is minor (mislabeling), so choose upper half of the allowed band → 0.82.",

Without provided difficulty definitions, applying Scenario 3 judgment: this does not reach a “hard” bar.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key = A.

No mismatches.\nChecklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): Not a worked example; no pre-attempt giveaways. Pass.\nChecklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus.

For Grade 2, “Easy” = recognize an explicit opinion statement and a simple because-clause giving a reason.\n\nAssessment Boundaries: None provided.\n\nLearning Objectives: None provided; inferred objective: identify opinion statements and link them to reasons using “because.”\n\nCommon Misconceptions: None provided; general expectations used (students may mistake any “because” clause for an opinion/reason link; may treat personal preferences as opinions even when the main clause is factual).\n\nItem Specifications: None provided.\n\nRequested Format Type (generation prompt): type = \"mcq\". Content includes 4 populated answer options → compliant.\n\nStep 1 – Read content: Stem: “Which sentence uses the word 'because' to connect an opinion and a reason?” Options A–D. Labeled correct answer: A. Explanation states A includes an opinion (“I think reading is fun”) supported by a reason (“because it lets me imagine new worlds”).\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): The labeled answer A matches the explanation and content. No mismatches.\n- Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway check for practice/assessment): No pre-attempt answer given; no reveal cues present; nothing trivializes the task.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus provided → N/A.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Clear and age-appropriate wording; no typos or merged words.\nConclusion: No issues identified. Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nScoring rationale: All binary metrics pass (1.0). Overall selected in 0.85–1.0 range per rules (C=0, N=0).
