One day she noticed a chipped clay bowl balanced on a rock, its water freezing fast. Though the wind nipped her cheeks, Tari filled her pouch with warm stones from the fire and placed them inside the bowl. The next morning the bowl held liquid water, and Tari found a single ripe blueberry in her hunting basket—enough to spoil for the journey home. Weeks later a terrible blizzard buried the mountain path. Tari slipped and dropped her lantern, leaving her stranded in the dark. Suddenly she heard a soft hum. The blueberry vine she had protected months before had grown into a thick curtain of berries dangling just above the snow. Tari ate two berries and felt warm strength flood her arms. She lit dry twigs beneath the vine, melted snow for water, and guided her shivering grandmother to safety.\n\nWhich statement BEST states the central message of the myth AND explains how it is conveyed through a key detail?",
