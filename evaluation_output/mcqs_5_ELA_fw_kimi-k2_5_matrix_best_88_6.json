    "question": "Read the passage below. Which choice best explains the relationship between the expansion of railroad networks and the development of steam-powered mine pumps?\n\nThe invention of high-pressure steam engines in the early 1800s revolutionized transportation. These engines generated more power using less coal than earlier low-pressure models, making them light enough for locomotives yet strong enough to pull heavy loads. As railroads expanded across Britain to transport goods and people, the demand for coal to fuel these engines grew dramatically. To meet this demand, mining companies dug deeper coal tunnels, which frequently flooded with groundwater. To combat this flooding, inventors adapted the same high-pressure steam technology to create powerful pumps that drained the mines efficiently. However, these pumps required substantial amounts of coal to operate, which in turn increased the pressure on mining operations to extract even more coal.",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Railroads were built primarily to transport steam-powered pumps from factories to coal mines in remote areas.",
      "B": "Steam-powered pumps were developed to address flooding in deep mines, which were dug to supply the coal demanded by expanding railroads that relied on high-pressure steam engines.",
      "C": "Engineers created high-pressure steam engines specifically for pumping water out of mines before later adapting them for use in railroad locomotives.",
      "D": "Mining companies adopted high-pressure steam engines for pumping because they were cheaper and more portable than the low-pressure engines previously used in shallow mines."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because it accurately traces the causal chain described in the text: the expansion of railroads increased coal demand, leading to deeper mines, which caused flooding problems that necessitated the development of steam-powered pumps adapted from the same high-pressure steam technology.",

    "question": "During the early 1800s, mining engineers struggled to remove water from deep coal pits. Newcomen's steam engines could do the job but consumed enormous amounts of coal. James Watt redesigned the engine by adding a separate condenser, which reduced fuel consumption by 75%. This efficiency made steam power economical for new applications. Matthew Boulton and Watt began manufacturing these engines for factories. Soon, inventors realized that portable steam engines could pull heavy loads. By 1830, steam locomotives were hauling coal and passengers along iron tracks, revolutionizing transportation.\n\nWhich choice best explains the relationship between James Watt's improved steam engine and the development of steam locomotives?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Watt's engine was originally designed specifically to pull coal cars directly from mines to cities.",
      "B": "Watt's engine provided an efficient power source that inventors later adapted to create self-moving locomotives.",

      "D": "Watt's engine was purchased by railway companies because it was cheaper than maintaining horses."

I had cost us the championship. As the buzzer sounded, I stared at the floor, too ashamed to look at my teammates. All I could think about was that one moment when everything slipped away.\n\n**Passage 2:** The crowd fell silent as the final shot circled the rim. When it dropped to the floor, the players hung their heads collectively. The coach immediately called them into a huddle, reminding them that one play doesn't define a season.

    "question": "A student watches a documentary and views an infographic about how honeybees communicate. The materials explain that when a forager bee discovers a food source, it returns to the hive and performs a waggle dance on the vertical surface of the honeycomb. The angle of the dance pattern relative to the vertical line indicates the direction of the food in relation to the sun: for example, a waggle run angled 40 degrees to the right of vertical means other bees should fly 40 degrees to the right of the sun. Additionally, the duration of the waggle portion of the dance indicates the distance to the food source—the longer the bee waggles, the farther away the flowers are located. Which choice best summarizes the information presented in the documentary and infographic?",

      "A": "Honeybees perform dances on honeycombs to tell other bees where to find flowers by showing both the direction and distance through specific dance movements.",

      "A": "School should start later because students are tired. Also, homework takes a long time. Besides, mornings are cold.",
      "B": "School should start later because teenagers need more sleep for healthy development. Research from the National Sleep Foundation shows that teens require 8–10 hours nightly. Additionally, later start times improve academic performance, as demonstrated by a study in Minnesota schools that showed higher test scores.",
      "C": "Teenagers need 8–10 hours of sleep. Minnesota schools had better scores. Therefore, school should start later.",
      "D": "School should start later because sleep is important and tests are hard. Sleep helps you grow. Hard tests are stressful."

Sedimentary rocks form when layers of sand, mud, and organic material accumulate over millions of years, compressing into solid stone through pressure and cementation. Metamorphic rocks develop when existing rocks undergo intense heat and pressure deep within the Earth, transforming their mineral composition and physical appearance without melting completely.

    "question": "Maya is writing an explanatory essay about how honeybees communicate the location of food sources. She has drafted the following body paragraphs: \"When a honeybee discovers a rich source of nectar, it returns to the hive and performs a special movement called the waggle dance. The direction of the dance indicates where the food is located relative to the sun, while the duration of the dance shows the distance. Other bees watch this dance and use the information to fly directly to the nectar source. Through this unique behavior, bees can efficiently gather food from flowers that are miles away.\" Which choice would provide the best concluding statement for Maya's essay?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Honeybees are fascinating insects that live in large colonies.",
      "B": "Thus, the waggle dance is a remarkable form of communication that allows bees to share precise information and work together to feed the colony.",
      "C": "Bees can become aggressive if someone approaches their hive.",
      "D": "The bee flew in a circle and then moved toward the east."

Because sunlight is free, homeowners can reduce or eliminate their monthly electricity bills. Additionally, recent studies indicate that houses equipped with solar panels often sell for higher prices than comparable homes without them. Second, solar energy provides important environmental benefits. Unlike fossil fuels, solar power generates electricity without producing harmful greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, coal mining can destroy natural landscapes, whereas solar panel installation requires no such destructive extraction.\n\nWhich choice correctly identifies how the author uses evidence to support each main point?",
