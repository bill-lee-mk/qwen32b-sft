      "D": "\"Swiftly\" shows the runner was moving backward, while \"sluggishly\" shows the runner was moving forward."

    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because the adverb \"swiftly\" describes moving with quick speed and energy, which explains why the runner left others behind as if winning the race, while \"sluggishly\" describes moving slowly with little energy or speed, which explains why the runner fell behind as if losing.

These cells fit together perfectly with no gaps in between. This shape saves space and holds the most honey. The queen bee lays eggs in some cells, while others are filled with honey.\n\nDiagram: The diagram shows a close-up pattern of hexagons locked together like a puzzle. Arrows point to the flat sides where each shape touches the next, highlighting that there are no spaces between them.\n\nWhich choice best explains how the diagram helps to clarify the text?",
