First, a worker bee drinks nectar from flowers using her long tongue. The nectar is stored in a special stomach called a honey stomach. When the bee returns to the hive, she passes the nectar to another bee mouth-to-mouth. This process adds enzymes that begin breaking down the nectar's sugars.\n\nNext, the bees drop the nectar into honeycomb cells. At this point, the nectar is still watery. To fix this, bees stand at the entrance of the hive and fan their wings rapidly. This moving air evaporates excess water from the nectar. Once the nectar becomes thick and sticky, it is officially honey. Finally, bees seal each honeycomb cell with wax to keep the honey fresh for winter.\n\nWhich choice best explains why bees must fan their wings over the nectar before sealing it in the honeycomb?",

As they move among flowers, tiny grains of pollen stick to their fuzzy bodies. When bees visit another flower, some of this pollen falls off. This process is called pollination, and it helps plants grow seeds and fruits. Many foods we eat, such as apples, blueberries, and almonds, depend on bees for pollination. Without honeybees, farmers would have a much harder time growing these crops. Scientists estimate that bees help produce about one-third of the food people eat.

He sat down on the bench under the oak tree and pulled out his book report. It was due tomorrow morning, and he still needed three more facts about cheetahs. His backpack felt lighter than usual.

Every morning for three months, he practiced with his old bow. He learned exactly how it felt in his hands, how far to pull the string, and how the wind affected each shot. The other archers had beautiful new equipment but had only practiced a few times. On competition day, Miko hit the center of every target.
