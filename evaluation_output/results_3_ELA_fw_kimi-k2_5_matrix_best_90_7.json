For Grade 3 L.3.1.A, “Easy” is identifying the function of a single, common part of speech (e.g., adverb) in a short, simple sentence with straightforward choices.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided.\n- Learning Objectives: Inferred — Students identify that “happily” functions as an adverb describing how the action occurred.\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided. Typical misconception: confusing adjectives with adverbs (thinking “happily” describes the child rather than the action).\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Generation prompt requested MCQ; item includes 4 answer options.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\nStep 1 – Intent: Practice/assessment MCQ (answer key and explanation are metadata, not student-facing pre-attempt).\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- No issues identified across metrics.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency):\n- Correct answer labeled D; explanation matches and accurately states that “happily” modifies “laughed.” Options correspond to noun/verb/adjective/adverb—consistent.\n\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway):\n- No student-facing giveaway. Answer appears only in metadata/explanation (post-attempt context assumed).\n\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo):\n- Stem is clear and grammatical. No merged words or stray symbols.\n\nMetric Scoring:\n- All binary metrics pass (1.0).

Generation prompt requested type: \"mcq\".\n\nRequested Format Type (Generation Prompt) Check:\n- Prompt type: mcq. Content has 4 populated answer options with keys A–D and a single correct answer key. Format matches request.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\nStep 1 (Read): Student-facing content is a single MCQ: Stem: \"Which group contains ONLY abstract nouns?\" Options A–D. Labeled correct answer: C. Explanation describes why C is correct (qualities/states that are ideas not physical objects).\n\nStep 2 – Issues (Commit):\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Labeled correct answer C matches content; explanation aligns with options and correctness. No mismatches.\n- Checklist B (Answer Giveaway): Practice/assessment MCQ; no pre-attempt giveaways; no reveal cues needed. Stem and choices do not reveal the answer.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Wording is clear, grammatical, age-appropriate. No merged words or stray symbols.\nNo issues identified. Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nStep 3 – Metric Scoring: With no identified issues, all binary metrics pass.\n\nStep 4 – Overall Score: C=0 (no critical metric failures), N=0 (no non-critical failures) ⇒ overall must be in 0.85–1.0. Item is clear, aligned, and well-constructed but not extraordinary; assign 0.96.\n\nData Source Documentation: Used provided item content and inferred curriculum standard L.3.1.C.

Distractors align well with these.\n- Item Specifications: None provided.\n\nB. Standard Evaluation Process\nStep 1: Identified student-facing content: clear stem asking for correct past tense forms in a paragraph; four MCQ options. No images.

Using Scenario 3: created difficulty bar based on typical Grade 3 expectations—Hard should involve multi-step use of dictionary features (guide words, alphabetical order beyond first letter, context to choose among homophones) rather than simple recall.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided. Documenting: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n- Learning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Students consult beginning dictionaries or reference tools to check/correct spelling or to choose correct spelling using dictionary cues.\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided. Inferred common errors: near-miss spellings (double consonants, missing silent letters), confusing homophones, misusing guide words/alphabetical ordering.\n- Item Specifications: None provided (no prescriptive item-writing rules). Generation prompt specified type: mcq. The item has 4 options—meets the requested type.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\nStep 2 – Issues (structured list):\n- ISSUE1 (educational_accuracy): Student-facing giveaway makes the answer trivial. Snippet: Option A text: \"The correct choice that matches the standard.\" This explicitly tells students which option is correct before attempting, for a practice/assessment MCQ with no reveal cue.\n- ISSUE2 (curriculum_alignment): Misalignment with L.3.2.G. Snippet: Stem \"Which choice best demonstrates the skill described in L.3.2.G at hard difficulty?\" and options do not involve consulting reference materials or correcting spellings; nothing about dictionaries/guide words/spellings is presented.\n- ISSUE3 (clarity_precision): Unclear/unnatural for Grade 3 students; references a code \"L.3.2.G\" without explanation. Snippet: \"Which choice best demonstrates the skill described in L.3.2.G...\" A typical 3rd grader would not know this code, making the task ambiguous.\n- ISSUE4 (distractor_quality): Implausible, non-parallel distractors. Snippets: \"An incorrect distractor.\", \"Another incorrect distractor.\" These are placeholders, not plausible alternatives tied to the skill.\n- ISSUE5 (reveals_misconceptions): Structure does not surface real misconceptions about dictionary/spelling use; distractors are generic labels.\n- ISSUE6 (difficulty_alignment): Labeled \"hard\" but effectively trivial due to explicit answer text and lack of any task requiring dictionary use or multi-step reasoning.\n- ISSUE7 (mastery_learning_alignment): No reasoning/application required; students can select A by reading the meta-label; does not distinguish partial vs full understanding.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency):\n- Answer key says A; explanation states A is correct; options include A; no mismatches found.\n\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway):\n- Type: MCQ practice/assessment. No reveal cues. Option A explicitly marks itself as correct. This is a trivial pre-attempt giveaway → educational_accuracy failure.\n\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo):\n- No merged words or stray symbols detected, but clarity issue arises from referencing standard code in student-facing stem.\n\nScoring Mechanics:\n- Critical metrics: educational_accuracy = 0.0; factual_accuracy = 1.0 → C=1.\n- Non-critical failures: curriculum_alignment, clarity_precision, reveals_misconceptions, difficulty_alignment, distractor_quality, mastery_learning_alignment → N=6.\n- Overall must be in 0.55–0.75.

Generation prompt type indicates mcq; content matches (populated answer_options).\n\nStep 2 – Issues (committed before scoring):\nISSUE1 (mastery_learning_alignment): The task primarily assesses recall of the correct spelling of ‘library’ rather than requiring students to use a reference or apply a procedure. Stem: “Which choice shows the correct spelling he should use?” This is a single-fact recall with no application of dictionary features (guide words, syllabication, entry reading). Fails Mastery Learning criterion that requires application/reasoning.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key B = 'library' matches options and explanation. No mismatches.\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway): No pre-attempt giveaways; no reveal text; the correct answer is not shown in the stem.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): Stem is clear and age-appropriate. Purposeful misspellings are confined to distractors; no merged non-words in stem.\n\nStep 3 – Metric scoring based on the single identified issue: Only mastery_learning_alignment fails.\n\nStep 4 – Overall score: C=0 (no critical fails), N=1 (one non-critical fail) → allowable overall range 0.75–0.84.

Also, Option A self-identifies as correct (\"The correct choice that matches the standard.\"), making the answer trivially obtainable pre-attempt.\n- ISSUE2 (clarity_precision): The reference to \"RF.3.3.C\" is opaque to a typical 3rd grader; without explaining the skill, it’s unclear what action/knowledge is expected beyond guessing a meta-labeled option.\n- ISSUE3 (curriculum_alignment): No multisyllable words or decoding task are present; item does not measure RF.3.3.C.\n- ISSUE4 (distractor_quality): Options B–D are generic (\"An incorrect distractor.\") and implausible; they don’t create a meaningful decision with the correct answer.\n- ISSUE5 (reveals_misconceptions): With placeholder distractors, the item cannot surface decoding-related misconceptions (e.g., V/CV vs VC/V errors).\n- ISSUE6 (difficulty_alignment): Labeled as \"medium\" but the task is trivial (Option A self-labels correctness); cognitive demand does not match a medium decoding task for Grade 3.\n- ISSUE7 (mastery_learning_alignment): No application of decoding skill; minimal reasoning; poor diagnostic value.\n\nChecklist A – Field Consistency: No explicit mismatches (answer key says A; explanation references option A and the standard generically). No contradictory values or references → no factual mismatch.\n\nChecklist B – Answer Giveaway Check: Practice/assessment item. The text of option A (“The correct choice that matches the standard.”) makes the correct answer trivial before attempt → counts as a giveaway under educational_accuracy.\n\nChecklist C – Diction/Typo: No typos/merged non-words, but the unexplained standard code is a clarity issue already captured in ISSUE2.\n\nScoring Mechanics:\n- Critical metrics: factual_accuracy = 1.0 (no concrete factual errors); educational_accuracy = 0.0 (misaligned purpose + answer giveaway)\n- Non-critical failures: curriculum_alignment, clarity_precision, distractor_quality, reveals_misconceptions, difficulty_alignment, mastery_learning_alignment → 6 fails\nOverall per rules (C=1, N≥3): score must be in 0.55–0.75.

While the format matches MCQ, the item fails to assess the intended skill and lacks clarity for 3rd graders.

Non-critical fails: curriculum_alignment, clarity_precision, reveals_misconceptions, difficulty_alignment, distractor_quality, mastery_learning_alignment (N=6). Deterministic overall range for C=1 & N≥3 is 0.55–0.75. Chosen 0.60 (lower half) due to a critical failure plus multiple non-critical failures.\n",

Curriculum Data Usage Documentation:\n- Confidence Level: SOFT (from provided curriculum context)\n- Standard Identification: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.3.10 – By the end of the year, read and comprehend informational texts at the high end of the grades 2–3 band independently and proficiently.\n- Difficulty Definitions: None provided in curriculum context → Scenario 3 (No Difficulty Definitions) applied. I assess difficulty based on typical Grade 3 expectations: “Hard” would involve denser informational text, multi-step comprehension (e.g., synthesizing main idea with supporting details), using text features, and citing evidence.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided.\n- Learning Objectives: None explicitly provided; inferred objective is reading and comprehending informational texts appropriate to grade band.\n- Common Misconceptions: None provided. Typical RI.3 misconceptions include: confusing main idea with a supporting detail, relying on background knowledge over textual evidence, misreading text features (headings, captions), and choosing statements not supported by the passage.\n- Item Specifications: None provided.\n- Requested Format Type (generation prompt): type = “mcq”. The item includes 4 answer_options (A–D). Format matches request.\n\nB. Standard Evaluation Process:\nStep 1: Read and Gather\n- Student-facing stem: “Which choice best demonstrates the skill described in RI.3.10 at hard difficulty?”\n- Options: A) “The correct choice that matches the standard.” B) “An incorrect distractor.” C) “Another incorrect distractor.” D) “Another incorrect distractor.”\n- No passage or stimulus provided. Labeled correct answer = A (metadata). Explanation: “Option A is correct…” (metadata).\n- Item intent: Practice/assessment (not a worked example), since there is no walkthrough and choices are presented for selection.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (Committed before scoring):\n- ISSUE1 (educational_accuracy): Stem asks students to pick a choice that “demonstrates the skill described in RI.3.10,” but provides no informational text to read or comprehend. This does not assess the skill of reading and comprehending informational texts; it instead asks a meta-question about the standard itself.\n- ISSUE2 (curriculum_alignment): RI.3.10 requires reading and comprehending informational texts. The item includes no passage or comprehension task, so it is misaligned with the standard.\n- ISSUE3 (clarity_precision): Stem uses internal curriculum code and test-construction language: “RI.3.10” and “at hard difficulty.” A typical Grade 3 student would not understand what RI.3.10 is or what “hard difficulty” means, making it unclear what action to take beyond guessing.\n- ISSUE4 (difficulty_alignment): Labeled difficulty is “hard,” but the task is trivial (Option A literally states “The correct choice that matches the standard.”). This is far below a “hard” RI.3 comprehension task.\n- ISSUE5 (distractor_quality): Choices are generic and implausible; the correct option is telegraphed by its wording (“The correct choice that matches the standard.”). Distractors (“An incorrect distractor.”) are not content-based and offer no plausible alternatives.\n- ISSUE6 (reveals_misconceptions): Distractors do not reflect real RI.3 misconceptions (e.g., selecting details instead of main idea, ignoring text evidence). They are placeholders, so the item provides no diagnostic value.\n- ISSUE7 (mastery_learning_alignment): Requires no reading, application, or evidence-based reasoning. It tests awareness of a meta-label, not mastery of reading informational text.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Labeled correct answer (A) matches explanation; no contradictions → PASS.\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway): Practice/assessment item. No explicit reveal cues are present, but the correct option is telegraphed via its wording; this is captured under distractor_quality and educational_accuracy (poor assessment of intended skill), not as an explicit pre-attempt answer key line → PASS for giveaway check.\nChecklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus present → N/A/PASS.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No typos, but semantic clarity issue due to code/difficulty language for Grade 3 → captured in ISSUE3.\n\nStep 3 – Metric Scores mapped to issues:\n- factual_accuracy: No factual contradictions → 1.0\n- educational_accuracy: ISSUE1 → 0.0\n- curriculum_alignment: ISSUE2 → 0.0\n- clarity_precision: ISSUE3 → 0.0\n- difficulty_alignment: ISSUE4 → 0.0\n- distractor_quality: ISSUE5 → 0.0\n- reveals_misconceptions: ISSUE6 → 0.0\n- mastery_learning_alignment: ISSUE7 → 0.0\n- passage_reference: No passage referenced or required by the stem → 1.0\n- stimulus_quality: No stimulus → 1.0\n- specification_compliance: No explicit item spec; requested MCQ format is met → 1.0\n- localization_quality: Neutral content, no cultural issues → 1.0\n\nStep 4 – Overall score per rules: C=1 (educational_accuracy=0.0). N=6 (clarity_precision, curriculum_alignment, difficulty_alignment, distractor_quality, reveals_misconceptions, mastery_learning_alignment = 0.0). With C=1 and N≥3, allowed range is 0.55–0.75.

The item includes four answer options and a labeled correct key → matches requested type.\n\nStep 1 – Student-facing content summary:\n- Stem asks to read a short paragraph and a reader’s point of view and choose which option best describes how the reader’s POV differs from the author’s.\n- Paragraph: Author acknowledges drawbacks but concludes benefits make it worthwhile.\n- Reader POV: Emphasizes noise/smell bothering neighbors more than benefits justify → opposes practice.\n- Options A–D; Answer key: A.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (commit list):\nISSUE1 (distractor_quality):\n- Snippet C: “The author focuses only on pests, while the reader focuses only on eggs.”\n  Problem: Misrepresents both perspectives. The author mentions both drawbacks and benefits; the reader emphasizes drawbacks (noise, smell), not eggs. This distractor is implausible and not aligned to a likely misconception regarding the reader’s stance.\n- Snippet D: “Neither the author nor the reader has an opinion about raising chickens.”\n  Problem: Obviously false; both clearly state an opinion. Low diagnostic value.\nPrimary metric: distractor_quality\n\nChecklist A – Field Consistency:\n- Answer key A aligns with options and explanation; explanation accurately references text (daily care/pests vs noise/smell, benefits vs community harm). No mismatches. PASS.\n\nChecklist B – Answer Giveaway:\n- Practice/assessment item. No pre-attempt giveaways. PASS.\n\nChecklist C – Diction/Typo:\n- Clear phrasing; no merged words or stray symbols. Vocabulary is advanced (“outweigh,” “drawbacks”) but acceptable for a hard Grade 3 item. PASS.\n\nMetric Scoring Mapping:\n- factual_accuracy: No factual or internal consistency errors → 1.0\n- educational_accuracy: Assesses comparing POVs appropriately; no giveaways → 1.0\n- curriculum_alignment: Matches RI.3.6 intent (distinguishing differing POVs). Although the standard specifies “their own” POV, comparing a provided reader POV to the author’s still practices the same distinction. SOFT confidence → pass. → 1.0\n- clarity_precision: Directions and options are clear and unambiguous → 1.0\n- specification_compliance: No explicit spec; format matches requested MCQ → 1.0\n- reveals_misconceptions: At least one plausible distractor (B) targets a real misconception (thinking both agree it’s too much work). → 1.0\n- difficulty_alignment: Using Scenario 3. The item’s vocabulary and comparative reasoning can be considered “hard” for Grade 3; acceptable. → 1.0\n- passage_reference: Properly references given paragraph and reader POV. → 1.0\n- distractor_quality: Two distractors (C, D) are implausible/low diagnostic value → 0.0\n- stimulus_quality: No stimulus image; N/A → 1.0\n- mastery_learning_alignment: Requires reasoning about contrasting viewpoints, not recall → 1.0\n- localization_quality: Neutral, age-appropriate context → 1.0\n\nOverall score determination per rules:\n- Critical fails (factual_accuracy, educational_accuracy): C = 0\n- Non-critical fails: N = 1 (distractor_quality)\n- Allowed range: 0.75–0.84. As a single, minor, easily fixable issue, choose upper half → 0.82.",
              "reasoning": "Strong alignment to RI.3.6: students compare the author’s view (benefits outweigh drawbacks) to a reader’s opposing view (drawbacks harm the community). The stem is clear, and the correct option and explanation are accurate. However, two distractors are weak: C misstates both perspectives, and D is obviously false. Improving those choices would enhance diagnostic value without changing the core item.",

For example: replace C with “The author believes the benefits make backyard chickens worthwhile, while the reader believes the problems make them not worthwhile for neighbors.” (role-reversal but incorrectly attributes positions); replace D with “Both the author and the reader think families should avoid raising backyard chickens, but for different reasons.” (plausible yet incorrect). Ensure all distractors reflect realistic misreadings (e.g., ignoring the concessive ‘although’ or confusing who supports/opposes)."

Using Scenario 3: own difficulty assessment based on grade-level expectations for RL.3.2.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided in the context. No explicit boundaries to enforce.\n- Learning Objectives: Not provided; inferred objective is to have students identify/explain the central message/moral of a story using key details.\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided; will use general pedagogical knowledge (e.g., confusing a topic/subject detail with a theme/moral; picking a specific event instead of a general message).\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Requested format type from generation prompt is “mcq”; item includes four answer options, satisfying the requested format.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\nStep 1 – Intent: This appears to be a practice/assessment MCQ (standalone prompt with choices; no instructional walkthrough). Therefore, pre-attempt text must not give away the answer.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (committed):\n- ISSUE1 (educational_accuracy): Giveaway and wrong educational purpose. Snippet: Option A text: “The correct choice that matches the standard.” This trivially signals the correct answer before any attempt. The stem is meta (“Which choice best demonstrates the skill described in RL.3.2 at hard difficulty?”) and does not actually assess RL.3.2 (no story/passage, no central message task). This fails the triviality test for practice items.\n- ISSUE2 (curriculum_alignment): Misalignment with RL.3.2. Snippet: Stem references RL.3.2 but does not require recounting a story or determining/explaining a central message via key details. No passage/context is provided.\n- ISSUE3 (clarity_precision): Ambiguous/jargon for Grade 3. Snippet: “demonstrates the skill described in RL.3.2 at hard difficulty” uses code/jargon a 3rd grader is unlikely to understand; unclear action required beyond meta-selection.\n- ISSUE4 (reveals_misconceptions): Distractors do not reflect plausible misconceptions. Snippets: “An incorrect distractor.” / “Another incorrect distractor.” These do not target typical RL.3.2 errors.\n- ISSUE5 (difficulty_alignment): Labeled difficulty = hard (from request). Actual cognitive demand is well below grade level because the correct answer is telegraphed by text (“The correct choice…”). This is at least two grade levels easier than intended and not aligned to DoK for RL.3.2.\n- ISSUE6 (distractor_quality): Implausible/telegraphed structure. Correct option declares itself “The correct choice…”, while others are generic “incorrect distractor.” This violates plausibility and telegraphs the key.\n- ISSUE7 (mastery_learning_alignment): Requires no reasoning or application; selection is based on label, not evidence-based reasoning from a text.\n\nChecklists:\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key = A; explanation says A is correct; options include A-D. No internal mismatches detected.\n- Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway, practice/assessment): Yes, explicit giveaway in student-facing option A text (“The correct choice…”). Fails.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus present; nothing to evaluate.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): No typos or merged non-words; primary clarity issue is semantic/jargon ambiguity, already captured in ISSUE3.\n\nScoring Mechanics:\n- Critical metrics failed: educational_accuracy = 0.0 (C=1)\n- Non-critical metrics failed: curriculum_alignment, clarity_precision, reveals_misconceptions, difficulty_alignment, distractor_quality, mastery_learning_alignment (N=6)\n- Deterministic overall range for C=1 & N≥3 is 0.55–0.75.

Using Scenario 3 assessment: For Grade 3 SL.3.1.A, “Medium” typically requires identifying evidence of preparation and extending discussion with a related idea, beyond simple recall.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided. Documenting: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n- Learning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Students identify behaviors showing preparation and use of prior knowledge to extend discussion ideas.\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided. Inferred typical misconceptions: (1) Sharing unrelated personal opinions/anecdotes; (2) Repeating article facts without extending; (3) Admitting lack of preparation yet offering opinion.\n- Item Specifications: None provided.\n\nRequested Format Type (Generation Prompt): type = \"mcq\". Validation: Content includes populated answer_options (4 choices) and a keyed correct answer. Format compliance confirmed.\n\nB. Standard Evaluation Process:\nStep 1 – Intent: This is a standalone practice/assessment MCQ (no instructional walkthrough). Student-facing content: stem and four options. Metadata: correct answer labeled B and an explanation.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (commit list before scoring):\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key = B; explanation aligns with option B’s text; options referenced correctly. No mismatches.\n- Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway in student-facing text): None. The only explicit answer appears in metadata/answer_explanation (assumed post-attempt/hidden). No reveal issues.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus present; N/A.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Clear, age-appropriate wording; no merged non-words or confusing symbols.\nConclusion: No issues identified. Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nC. Metric-specific notes:\n- Factual Accuracy: The explanation is correct and consistent with the options and the standard: bees carry pollen; extending to butterflies is a reasonable exploratory idea.\n- Educational Accuracy: The item precisely targets SL.3.1.A by asking which response shows preparation (citing the article) and exploration (posing a related question).\n- Curriculum Alignment: Directly aligned to SL.3.1.A; distractors map to common misalignments (lack of prep, irrelevant personal anecdote, mere repetition).\n- Difficulty Alignment: Scenario 3 used. The cognitive demand is application/analysis to select the best evidence of preparation and extension, appropriate as Medium for Grade 3.\n- Passage Reference: No external passage required; the scenario is self-contained.\n- Distractor Quality: Plausible and diagnostically useful: A (no prep + opinion), C (irrelevant personal connection), D (repeats fact without extension), B (correct: cites and extends).\n- Localization: Neutral classroom context; culturally accessible.\n\nDeterministic Overall Score: No metric failures (C=0, N=0) ⇒ overall must be in [0.85, 1.0]. High quality with strong alignment and distractors; assign 0.96 (acceptable to superior range).\n",

Documenting: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n- Learning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Students plan and deliver an oral report including appropriate facts and relevant descriptive details, and speak clearly at an understandable pace.\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided. Using general pedagogy: Students may overemphasize facts without delivery clarity, use only descriptive detail without factual support, or include irrelevant details, all of which distract from the standard’s criteria.\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Documenting: No Item Specifications provided.\n- Requested Format Type (Generation Prompt): type = \"mcq\".

Using general pedagogy: students may respond with sentence fragments or insufficient detail.\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Generation prompt requested MCQ; item includes 4 options and a single keyed answer, which matches the requested type.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\nStep 1 (Intent): This is a practice/assessment MCQ. Student-facing content includes the stem and four options; the answer key/explanation are metadata and not visible pre-attempt.\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key = B. Option B text matches explanation rationale (complete sentence with subject “I” and verb “made”; adds detail about baking soda). No mismatches found.\n- Checklist B (Answer Giveaway): No answer or rationale is shown in student-facing content. No reveal issue.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Stem is clear and grammatical. Options A/C/D are intentionally fragments; no typos or merged words.\nNo issues identified.\n\nScoring Mechanics: With no issues across critical or non-critical metrics, all binary metrics = 1.0. Overall must be in 0.85–1.0 range; assigning 0.96 as a strong acceptable item with clear alignment and good distractors.\n\nDeviation Justification: N/A (no conflicting curriculum data).",
