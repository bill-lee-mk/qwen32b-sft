Based on the passage, how did both 'push' and 'pull' factors influence the Great Migration?\n\nBetween 1916 and 1970, approximately six million African Americans moved from the rural South to cities in the North, West, and Midwest. This movement became known as the Great Migration. Before this time, most African Americans lived in southern states where they worked primarily in agriculture. Many worked as sharecroppers, farming land owned by others and sharing a portion of their crops as payment.\n\nSeveral factors pushed people to leave the South. Agricultural problems, including a boll weevil infestation that destroyed cotton crops, made farming difficult. Strict segregation laws limited opportunities for African Americans in southern states. Meanwhile, factors in northern cities pulled migrants toward new homes. Factory jobs were plentiful, especially during World War I when many workers left for military service. Wages in northern factories were higher than what farm workers earned in the South.\n\nThe Great Migration transformed American cities. Newcomers established neighborhoods, churches, and businesses. They created vibrant communities that contributed to music, art, and literature during the Harlem Renaissance. However, migrants also faced challenges. Many encountered discrimination and crowded housing conditions. Despite these difficulties, the Great Migration shaped American society and paved the way for future civil rights movements.",

As the water vapor rises higher, it cools down and condenses, turning back into tiny liquid droplets. These droplets form clouds. When the droplets become heavy enough, they fall back to Earth as precipitation in the form of rain, snow, or hail.

Without pollination, many plants would not be able to make seeds or grow fruits and vegetables. Farmers depend on honeybees to help grow crops like apples, almonds, and blueberries.\n\nHoneybees also make honey. They collect sweet liquid called nectar from flowers and bring it back to their hive. Inside the hive, worker bees turn the nectar into honey and store it in wax cells. Honey is a healthy food that people have enjoyed for thousands of years.\n\nHoneybees live together in large groups called colonies. Each colony has one queen bee, hundreds of male bees called drones, and thousands of female worker bees. The queen bee lays eggs, while the worker bees do all the other jobs.

    "question": "Read the passage below and answer the question.\n\nHoneybees: Nature's Tiny Workers\n\nHoneybees are some of the most important insects on Earth. While they may seem small, they play a very big role in our world. One of the most important things honeybees do is pollinate flowers. When bees visit flowers to collect nectar, they get pollen on their fuzzy bodies. As they fly from flower to flower, they drop some of this pollen, which helps new plants grow. Without bees, many of the fruits and vegetables we eat would not exist. Apples, blueberries, and cucumbers all need bees to grow.\n\nHoneybees also make honey in their hives. Worker bees collect nectar from flowers and bring it back to the hive. Inside the hive, they turn the nectar into honey and store it in wax cells called honeycomb. This honey provides food for the bees during winter when flowers are not blooming. People have been collecting honey from bees for thousands of years because it tastes delicious and can be used in many foods.\n\nAnother important job honeybees have is working together as a team. Each bee has a specific role in the hive. Some bees are guards who protect the hive from danger. Others are builders who create the honeycomb. The queen bee lays eggs to keep the hive growing. By working together, the hive can survive and thrive for many years.\n\nHoneybees may be tiny, but their work affects our lives every day. From the food on our plates to the honey in our kitchens, we have bees to thank for many wonderful things.\n\nWhich option best states the main idea of the passage?",

    "question": "Read the passage below and answer the question.\n\nBees are small insects, but they do a very big job for our world. These busy creatures are pollinators, which means they help plants make seeds and fruit. When a bee lands on a flower to drink nectar, tiny grains of pollen stick to its fuzzy body. As the bee flies to another flower, some of that pollen falls off. This process, called pollination, helps plants grow new seeds. Without bees, many of the foods we eat would not exist. Apples, strawberries, and almonds all need bees to grow. Farmers depend on bees to help their crops produce food.\n\nBees live together in hives, working as a team. Each bee has a special job. The queen bee lays eggs, while worker bees build the hive, find food, and protect their home. A single hive can have thousands of bees, all working together.

An ant can lift and carry objects that weigh 20 to 50 times its own body weight. To understand how impressive this is, imagine a human lifting a car over his head! Ants can perform these amazing feats of strength because their bodies are built differently from larger animals. Their muscles are attached to their exoskeletons—the hard outer shells that protect their bodies—which gives them excellent leverage. Additionally, ants do not have heavy bones inside their bodies like humans do, so more of their body weight is devoted to muscle.

Orville and Wilbur Wright, two brothers from Ohio, were determined to prove everyone wrong. They opened a bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio, which gave them both money to fund their experiments and mechanical skills they needed to build their flying machine.\n\nThe brothers studied birds in flight and noticed that birds adjusted their wings to stay balanced. This observation inspired them to design a system where pilots could control the wings of their aircraft. They tested many different wing shapes in a wind tunnel they built themselves, collecting data on which shapes created the most lift.\n\nAfter years of testing and several failed attempts with gliders, the Wright brothers traveled to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903. They chose this location because it had strong, steady winds and soft sand that would cushion any crashes. On December 17, 1903, Orville Wright piloted their powered aircraft, the Flyer, for 12 seconds, covering 120 feet. This was the first successful powered flight in history.\n\nThe Wright brothers succeeded where many others had failed because they combined careful scientific research with practical engineering skills.

Without enough light, plants cannot produce the energy they need to grow and stay healthy. Scientists discovered that plants actually grow toward light sources. This behavior is called phototropism. When light shines on a plant from one side, the cells on the shaded side grow longer than the cells on the lighted side. This uneven growth causes the plant to bend toward the light. This happens because a plant hormone called auxin moves away from light and causes cells to grow longer. By bending toward light, plants can capture more sunlight for photosynthesis.\n\nWhich choice explains why plants bend toward light, according to the passage?",

    "question": "Read the story and answer the question.\n\nMarcus had always wanted to play guitar on stage at the school talent show. For weeks, he practiced the same song over and over in his bedroom. His little sister, Tia, would clap from the hallway, but Marcus always stopped playing whenever anyone else walked by.\n\nOn the day of the show, Marcus sat in the auditorium, his guitar case at his feet. He watched his classmates perform—one student told jokes, another did a magic trick, and a group sang together. Each time the audience clapped, Marcus felt his stomach tighten.\n\n\"Marcus Chen, you're up next,\" announced Mr. Rivera.\n\nMarcus stood up slowly. His hands were shaking as he walked to the center of the stage. He looked out at the sea of faces and forgot the first note. The room was silent. Then, from the back row, he saw Tia give him a big thumbs-up.\n\nMarcus took a deep breath. He closed his eyes and imagined he was back in his bedroom. His fingers found the strings, and he began to play. The music flowed, and when he opened his eyes, he saw people smiling. When he finished, the applause was louder than he'd ever heard.\n\nWalking off stage, Marcus realized that the hardest part wasn't playing the guitar—it was walking onto the stage in the first place. Next year, he promised himself, he wouldn't wait so long to sign up.\n\nWhich sentence best states a theme of the story?",

His realization that \"the hardest part wasn't playing the guitar—it was walking onto the stage in the first place\" shows that the theme is about having the courage to act despite fear.",

You have a great voice.\"\n\nMarcus shook his head. \"I couldn't. I'd be too scared.\"\n\nFor the next week, Marcus watched other students practice in the music room. He saw Tasha struggling with her guitar chords, hitting wrong notes again and again. But she kept trying. By Friday, her song sounded smooth and confident.\n\nOn Monday, Marcus found Tasha in the hallway. \"How did you get so good so fast?\" he asked.\n\n\"I didn't,\" she laughed. \"I made mistakes every day. But each time I messed up, I learned something new. Now I know exactly which chords trip me up.\"\n\nMarcus thought about this all day. That afternoon, he signed up for the talent show. Every evening, he practiced his song in his room. Sometimes his voice cracked. Sometimes he forgot the words. But each mistake taught him what to fix.\n\nThe night of the talent show, Marcus walked onto the stage with trembling legs. But when he began to sing, he remembered all those evenings of practice. His voice grew stronger with each line. When he finished, the audience clapped and cheered.\n\nAfterward, Tasha hugged him. \"You were amazing!\"\n\nMarcus smiled. \"I made so many mistakes practicing, but those mistakes helped me get better.\"\n\nWhich sentence best states a theme of the story?",

      "A": "Recycling helps our planet in many ways. My family recycles bottles and cans every week. We have a blue bin for paper and plastic. Sometimes we forget to put the bin out on trash day. Recycling centers process materials to be used again. It's important to rinse containers before recycling them.",
      "B": "Recycling is when you take old things and make them into new things. Paper can be recycled. Plastic can be recycled. Glass can be recycled. Metal can be recycled. Many things can be recycled.",
      "C": "Recycling is important for several reasons. First, recycling reduces the amount of trash that goes into landfills, which helps keep our Earth clean. Second, recycling saves natural resources like trees and water because we can use materials again instead of harvesting new ones. Finally, recycling uses less energy than making products from scratch, which helps reduce pollution. These benefits show why everyone should try to recycle.",
      "D": "You must recycle to save the planet! Don't you care about the environment? Everyone should feel responsible for reducing waste. If you don't recycle, you're hurting future generations. We need to act now before it's too late. Recycling is not optional—it's something everyone must do!"

    "question": "Read the passage:\n\nMany experts argue that regular exercise improves students' academic performance. A 2019 study published in the Journal of School Health followed 500 students over one school year. Students who exercised for at least 30 minutes daily scored 15% higher on math tests than students who did not exercise regularly. The researchers explained that physical activity increases blood flow to the brain, which helps students concentrate better during class. Additionally, schools that added morning exercise programs reported fewer students falling asleep during lessons. This combination of test score data and biological research provides strong support for the connection between exercise and academic success.\n\nWhich choice best explains how the author uses reasons and evidence to support the point that exercise improves academic performance?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "By describing different types of exercise students can do",
      "B": "By presenting statistical data from a study and explaining the biological reasons behind the results",
      "C": "By comparing academic performance in different countries",
      "D": "By listing opinions from teachers about student behavior"
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because the author supports the point by providing statistical evidence from a research study (students who exercised scored 15% higher on math tests) and explaining the biological reasons for this result (physical activity increases blood flow to the brain, which helps concentration). The author uses both numerical data and scientific explanation as evidence to support the claim about exercise improving academic performance.",
