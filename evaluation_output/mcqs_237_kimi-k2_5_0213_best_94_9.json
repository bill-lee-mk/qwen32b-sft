Forager bees fly to blossoms and suck up sweet nectar with their tongues. They store it in a special stomach called a crop. Back at the hive, they spit the nectar into the mouths of house bees. These house bees add enzymes that change the nectar's sugars. Then they spread the liquid into empty wax cells. Next, many bees stand in lines and fan their wings rapidly over the cells. This fanning creates a breeze that evaporates water from the nectar. Once the water is gone, the nectar becomes thick honey that will not spoil. Finally, bees seal the cells with wax lids to store the honey for winter.\n\nWhich choice best explains what would happen if the bees did not fan their wings over the cells?",

As bees travel from flower to flower gathering sweet nectar for their hives, they accidentally carry pollen on their fuzzy bodies and legs. This process, called pollination, allows plants to create seeds and grow fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Scientists estimate that approximately one-third of all the food humans consume depends directly on honeybee pollination. Without these hardworking insects, farms would produce significantly less food, and many favorite snacks would become rare and expensive. Unfortunately, honeybee populations around the world are declining rapidly because of harmful pesticides, diseases, and disappearing wildflower fields. If bees continue to disappear, both natural ecosystems and human food supplies face serious danger. To prevent this crisis, communities are planting bee-friendly gardens and farmers are finding safer ways to protect their crops.\n\nWhich option correctly identifies the main idea of the passage and explains how a key detail supports it?",

Yesterday, he had stood tall and proud, carrot nose pointing toward the clouds, stick arms wide as if ready to hug the world. But today, the sun blazed fierce and white, and the snowman sagged at the shoulders, his middle shrinking like a melting candle.\n\n\"Can we save him?\" Kira asked, pressing her palm against the cold glass.\n\nPapa came to stand beside her, his hand heavy and warm on her shoulder. \"Everything changes, little bird,\" he said. \"The snowman came from the clouds, and now he's returning to them. See the steam rising? That's him waving good-bye.\"\n\nKira squinted. Silver ribbons twisted upward from the snowman's fading head, dancing toward the blue. Her chest felt tight, like a fist squeezing her heart. She thought of the way her grandmother's old dog had slept in the sunny spot last summer, never waking up, and how Grandma had said, \"He's just changed his shape, Kira. Still here, just different.\"\n\nThe snowman's coal eyes slipped down his face, landing with soft thumps in the shrinking snow. Kira opened the window and caught a cold droplet on her tongue.

Fearful that villagers would mock her vivid colors, Ana wrapped each finished bowl in heavy cloth and hid them in her shed. One afternoon, her elderly neighbor Maria spotted a flash of blue peeking from beneath a wrap. 'Child,' Maria said, 'those colors could chase the gloom from our dull market square.' Ana trembled, but the next morning she placed three bowls on a wooden table at the village market. Travelers paused, amazed by the dancing flowers, and by sunset every bowl was sold.
