Options include syllabic and morphemic chunking. Key marked B; explanation cites prefix dis-, base appoint, suffix -ment.\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\nISSUE1 (clarity_precision): Snippet: “Which option shows the BEST way to break the word 'disappointment' into parts to help decode it?” Ambiguity: “break … into parts” could mean syllables (dis/ap/point/ment) or meaningful morphemes (dis/appoint/ment). A typical student might interpret “parts” as syllables, leading to A rather than the intended B. This changes the answer choice and creates semantic ambiguity about what kind of “parts” are expected.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key B matches options and explanation. No mismatches.\nChecklist B (Giveaway): No pre-attempt giveaways; no hidden/reveal content.\nChecklist C (Typos/Diction): No typos or merged words; punctuation and capitalization fine.\n\nStep 3 – Metric scoring: factual_accuracy=1.0 (correct segmentation and rationale); educational_accuracy=1.0 (assesses decoding via chunking; no giveaway); curriculum_alignment=1.0 (fits RF.3.3.C and also leverages prefixes/suffixes from adjacent RF standards); clarity_precision=0.0 (documented ambiguity); specification_compliance=1.0 (no enforceable spec provided); reveals_misconceptions=1.0 (distractors map to plausible strategies/errors); difficulty_alignment=1.0 (for G3, selecting best morphological chunking of a long word is appropriately at least medium-to-hard; labeled hard acceptable; no difficulty definitions provided → applied general expectations); passage_reference=1.0 (N/A); distractor_quality=1.0 (plausible, parallel, balanced length); stimulus_quality=1.0 (no stimulus); mastery_learning_alignment=1.0 (requires analysis/strategy, not mere recall); localization_quality=1.0 (neutral and age-appropriate).\n\nStep 4 – Overall: C=0 (no critical fails), N=1 (one non-critical fail). Per rules, overall must be 0.75–0.84. Chosen 0.83 (upper half) because the single failure is minor and easily fixable by clarifying the stem.\n\nStep 5 – Consistency: The single issue is reflected only in clarity_precision; all other metrics pass.",

Note: A does not explicitly say “listens without interrupting,” but no rule is contradicted and inviting others reasonably implies readiness to listen; not ambiguous enough to fail → pass.\n- Specification compliance: No enforceable item spec provided (SOFT context) → pass.\n- Reveals misconceptions: Distractors map to common rule violations (speaking before called, off-topic, no invite, etc.) → pass.\n- Difficulty alignment: No difficulty definitions provided; using general bar for Grade 3 SL: item requires checking multiple conditions across options (application), appropriate for grade; not 2+ grade levels off → pass.\n- Passage reference: N/A → pass.\n- Distractor quality: Plausible, parallel, balanced; none telegraph the correct choice → pass.\n- Stimulus quality: No stimulus → pass.\n- Mastery learning: Requires applying multiple criteria, not mere recall → pass.\n- Localization: Neutral classroom context; age-appropriate → pass.\n\nStep 4 – Overall: C=0, N=0 → overall must be in 0.85–1.0. Choose 0.95 (acceptable-high).",
