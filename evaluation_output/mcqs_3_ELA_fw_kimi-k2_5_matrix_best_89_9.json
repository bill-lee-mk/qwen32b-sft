The journey takes two months, yet the insects that arrive are not the same ones that departed. Monarchs live short lives, so the original travelers lay eggs along the way and die. Their children, and then their grandchildren, continue the trip. Strangely, the great-grandchildren return north in spring to the exact same forests their great-grandparents left. How do they find these spots without ever seeing them before?\n\nScientists discovered that monarchs carry a biological clock that tracks the sun's movement across the sky. This clock works together with special cells in the butterflies' bodies that detect Earth's magnetic field. Together, these tools create a natural compass. However, researchers noticed a problem. When butterflies are raised indoors away from natural light, they lose their sense of direction. Even when released outdoors, these butterflies cannot find south. Scientists now think that seeing natural sunlight during early life is necessary to activate their magnetic compass.\n\nWhich statement is best supported by details from the passage about monarchs raised indoors?",

When a worker bee discovers a patch of flowers rich with nectar, it returns to the hive and performs a unique dance on the vertical honeycomb surface. This behavior, known as the waggle dance, conveys precise information about the food source's location to other bees. During the performance, the bee waggles its abdomen while moving in a straight line, then loops back to repeat the motion. The angle of the straight line indicates the direction of the flowers relative to the sun's position, while the duration of the waggling signals the distance.

    "question": "The Last Leaf\n\nMara stood at the bus stop, her canvas bag heavy with books. The maple tree beside the bench was nearly bare. One stubborn leaf clung to a high branch, trembling in the November wind.\n\nHer grandfather had planted that tree when Mara was born. Now his house stood empty across the street, the windows dark like closed eyes. The bus rumbled around the corner.\n\nMara reached into her pocket and touched the smooth stone her grandfather had given her last summer. \"Stones remember,\" he had said. \"They hold still while everything else changes.\"\n\nThe wind gusted. The leaf shivered but did not fall. Mara gripped the stone and stepped onto the bus. Through the window, she watched the tree grow smaller, the single leaf bright against the gray sky. She opened her palm and looked at the stone. For the first time since the funeral, her chest felt light, like something inside her had finally let go.\n\nWhich choice best describes how Mara changes during the story?",

The wind outside whistled through the cracks, making the lantern swing gently. She pulled her thin sweater tighter, listening to the creaking boards above.\"\n\nIllustration: The illustration shows Maya huddled in a dim corner of a weathered barn. Heavy shadows stretch across the wooden planks behind her, while a single lantern hangs crookedly, casting a weak, flickering yellow light that barely reaches her face.
