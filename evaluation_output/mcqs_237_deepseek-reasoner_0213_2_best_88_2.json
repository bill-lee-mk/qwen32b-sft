His friends teased him, saying his work was wasted. Kai didn't give up. He watched how the waves moved and noticed that castles built with wet sand lasted longer. He started building farther from the water and packed the sand tightly. One afternoon, a sudden storm brought strong winds and waves. When the storm passed, all the other beach structures were ruined, but Kai's sandcastle stood firm.
