This is a field/content mismatch between explanation and actual student-facing content.\nISSUE2a – educational_accuracy: Snippet: option A “The correct choice that matches the standard.” Problem: Explicit telegraph of correctness in student-facing option makes the answer trivially obtainable pre-attempt (practice/assessment context), violating the no-giveaway rule.\nISSUE2b – educational_accuracy: Snippet: stem “Which choice best demonstrates the skill described in L.3.2.A at hard difficulty?” with options that do not present any title or capitalization content. Problem: The item does not assess the intended skill at all; there’s nothing to analyze or apply.\nISSUE3 – clarity_precision: Snippet: stem “the skill described in L.3.2.A at hard difficulty.” Problem: Uses internal standard code and difficulty jargon unfamiliar to Grade 3 students; unclear what evidence to use.
