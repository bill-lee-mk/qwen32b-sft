Curriculum Data Usage\n- Confidence Level: SOFT (from content inference)\n- Target Standard: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.K.1.D – Understand and use question words (interrogatives) (e.g., who, what, where, when, why, how).\n- Difficulty Definitions: None provided in curriculum context → Scenario 3 (create our own bar).\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided.\n- Learning Objectives: Not provided; inferred objective is selecting an appropriate interrogative word to match given information.\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided; typical K-level misconceptions include confusing which-word functions (e.g., using “who” for non-people, “where” for actions).\n- Item Specifications: None provided.\n\nB. Standard Evaluation Process\nStep 1 – Identify intent: Standalone MCQ practice/assessment. Student-facing content: stem “Which choice correctly completes the question? The rabbit hopped quickly to its burrow. _____ did the rabbit hop?” Options A Who, B What, C Where, D How. No pre-attempt answer giveaways. Answer/explanation are metadata only.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (committed list):\nISSUE1 (clarity_precision): Snippet: “The rabbit hopped quickly to its burrow. _____ did the rabbit hop?” Explanation: The sentence contains both a manner cue (“quickly”) and a location phrase (“to its burrow”). Thus two interrogatives—“How did the rabbit hop?” and “Where did the rabbit hop?”—are both grammatically and contextually coherent completions. The stem doesn’t specify which aspect (manner vs place) the question should target, creating ambiguity for students and yielding multiple plausible interpretations that change the answer.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): The labeled correct answer D (How) matches the explanation and the options; no mismatches found.\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway): None in pre-attempt content; metadata contains the answer but is not student-facing.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No typos or merged words. Note: “burrow” may be advanced vocabulary for K, but it does not create ambiguity; it’s a suggestion, not an issue.\n\nStep 3 – Metric scoring: Only clarity_precision fails due to ambiguity. All other metrics have no identified issues and thus pass.\n\nStep 4 – Overall score: C=0 (no factual/educational failures), N=1 (clarity). Deterministic range: 0.75–0.84. The single failure is localized and easily fixable, so choose the upper half: 0.82.\n\nC. Deviations: None from provided curriculum data (none given beyond standard description).

Inferred objective: Recognize and select a sentence that expands a simple base sentence by adding details (where/setting/additional descriptive information). The item supports this by asking which option adds the most details to “The cat sleeps.”\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided. Anticipated misconceptions: choosing an option with only one added detail (location or setting) instead of the most detailed; equating sentence length with detail without checking content (all distractors remain plausible within this frame).\n- Item Specifications: None provided.\n\nB. Standard Evaluation Process:\nStep 1 – Read and Gather: Student-facing stem asks for the choice that adds the most details; four MC options progressively add details. No images, hints, or on-demand feedback. Metadata labels D as correct with a rationale consistent with options.\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): The explanation matches the correct option D and accurately describes added details. No mismatches.\n- Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): No student-facing answer or giveaway; the correct answer is only in metadata. The task requires comparing detail content, appropriate for K.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus present – N/A.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Clear, age-appropriate wording; no typos or merged words.\nNo issues identified. Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nC. Deviation Justification: None needed; used inferred standard with SOFT confidence and Scenario 3 for difficulty due to no provided definitions.\n\nScoring mechanics: With no identified issues, all binary metrics score 1.0. Overall must be in 0.85–1.0 range; selected 0.96 as a strong, clean item with solid alignment and quality.",

Using Scenario 3: creating my own difficulty bar based on typical K expectations for phoneme–grapheme mapping and conventional spelling recognition.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided. Documenting: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n- Learning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Given a spoken simple CVC word, the student identifies the correct (conventional) spelling by applying knowledge of sound–letter correspondences.\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided. Inferred likely misconceptions: using alternate but plausible graphemes for /k/ (k vs c), short-vowel confusion (a vs u), letter order errors.\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Requested format (generation prompt): type = mcq. Content includes 4 populated answer options → compliant.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\nStep 1: This is a practice/assessment MCQ. Student-facing: stem and four options.

Options match; no mismatches. PASS.\n- Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): No explicit answer presented in student-facing text; the key appears only in metadata. PASS.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No image; audio is implied by the stem (“Listen to the word”). Nothing contradicts the prompt. PASS.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Clear, age-appropriate language. No merged words or stray symbols. PASS.\nNo issues identified. Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nMetric-specific reasoning:\n- Factual accuracy: Options and explanation align; the phoneme–grapheme claim (/k/ /æ/ /t/) correctly matches “cat.” No contradictions.\n- Educational accuracy: The task matches intent—choosing the conventional spelling of a heard CVC word using letter–sound knowledge. No pre-attempt giveaways.\n- Curriculum alignment: Selecting the correct conventional spelling from a set relies on phonetic decoding/encoding knowledge aligned with L.K.2.D. While the standard emphasizes phonetic spelling production, recognition/selection is a reasonable assessment proxy in K.\n- Clarity & precision: Stem is clear with expected platform audio. Action required is unambiguous.\n- Specification compliance: No clear spec beyond format; the item matches the requested MCQ type.\n- Reveals misconceptions: Distractors map to plausible K-level errors (k for /k/, vowel swap, letter order).\n- Difficulty alignment: With no provided definitions, Scenario 3 applied. For K, contrasting “cat” vs “kat” requires knowledge of conventional orthographic pattern (c before a) beyond pure phonetics; presence of vowel and order distractors raises cognitive demand. Label “hard” is reasonable for K.\n- Passage reference: N/A.\n- Distractor quality: Parallel single-word options; each is plausible and diagnostic; none telegraph the answer by length or style.\n- Stimulus quality: No harmful or misleading stimulus; implied audio is appropriate.\n- Mastery learning alignment: Requires applying sound–letter correspondences from an audio stimulus—diagnostic of genuine understanding.\n- Localization: Neutral content, culturally universal.\n\nDeterministic Overall Scoring:\n- Critical metric failures: C=0 (factual_accuracy=1.0, educational_accuracy=1.0)\n- Non-critical failures: N=0\n→ Overall must be in 0.85–1.0 range.

No images. \n- Metadata: correct answer A, explanation: broccoli is a vegetable; others are fruits. No hints/feedback.\n- Intent: Practice/assessment MCQ.\n\nCurriculum Data Usage\n- Standard Identification: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.K.5.A (Vocabulary Acquisition and Use: sort common objects into categories). Confidence: SOFT (from content inference provided).\n- Difficulty Definitions: None provided in context (all <unspecified>). Scenario 3 applied: define difficulty judgment based on typical K expectations. Medium would involve basic categorization with some need for prior knowledge; item without pictures may increase demand modestly compared to pure picture sorting.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided. Documented: “No Assessment Boundaries provided.”\n- Learning Objectives: Not provided; inferred objective: recognize categories (foods) and select another item in the same category as a given example (vegetables vs fruits).\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided; inferred likely misconception: confusing fruits and vegetables.\n- Item Specifications: None provided. “No Item Specifications provided.”\n- Requested Format Type (Generation Prompt): type = mcq. Validation: content includes 4 populated answer_options; matches request.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (commit before scoring)\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Explanation matches options and labeled correct answer (A). No mismatches.\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway): No answer revealed in student-facing content; answer only in metadata. No giveaway.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): Clear, age-appropriate wording; no merged words or confusing symbols.\nResult: No issues identified. Checklists A, B, and C passed.\n\nStep 3 – Metric Scoring Justification\n- Factual Accuracy: Broccoli is a vegetable; apple/banana/orange are fruits. Correct answer A consistent with explanation and options.\n- Educational Accuracy: Directly assesses categorization of common objects by type (food category), aligned to standard’s intent. No giveaways.\n- Curriculum Alignment: Matches L.K.5.A (sorting into categories; recognizing category membership). Within typical K scope.\n- Clarity & Precision: Unambiguous task; “also a vegetable like a carrot” clearly signals category comparison.\n- Specification Compliance: No explicit item specs; format matches requested mcq.\n- Reveals Misconceptions: Distractors are all fruits, a plausible confusion against vegetables; good diagnostic value.\n- Difficulty Alignment: With no provided definitions, Scenario 3 applied. For K, recognizing another vegetable among fruits without pictures is a simple categorization relying on common knowledge—reasonable as “medium” within K due to absence of visual support; certainly not ≥2 grade levels off.\n- Passage Reference: N/A, no passage.\n- Distractor Quality: Parallel, homogeneous set (foods), plausible, single clear correct answer.\n- Stimulus Quality: No stimulus; not required.\n- Mastery Learning Alignment: Requires applying category knowledge rather than rote recall of a single fact; diagnostic value present.\n- Localization Quality: Neutral, globally familiar foods; culturally appropriate.\n\nStep 4 – Overall Score\nC=0 (no failures in factual_accuracy or educational_accuracy); N=0 (no other failures). Deterministic range = 0.85–1.0. Choose 0.95 (acceptable) as strong quality with minor potential enhancement possible (e.g., optional visuals for K learners).\n\nCurriculum Validation Checklist\n- Standard(s): CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.K.5.A; Confidence: SOFT.\n- Difficulty Definitions: Not provided → Scenario 3 documented and applied.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided.\n- Learning Objectives: Inferred; aligned as noted.\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided; used general pedagogical knowledge.\n- Requested Format Type: mcq specified and matched (4 options present).\n- Item Specifications: None provided.\n- Data sources: Used student-facing content for metrics; metadata for correctness verification; curriculum context for alignment and difficulty documentation.",

Scenario 3 applied – used professional judgment for Kindergarten ELA print concepts. Medium difficulty judged reasonable because students must visually compare near-identical sentences to spot spacing errors (more demanding than a simple yes/no check).\n\nAssessment Boundaries: None provided. Documented as: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n\nLearning Objectives: None explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Students identify correct spacing in a sentence (spaces between words; no extra space before punctuation).\n\nCommon Misconceptions: None provided. Inferred likely misconceptions: omitting a space between words (e.g., “Thecat”), inserting extra spaces between words, inserting a space before punctuation.\n\nItem Specifications: None provided.\n\nRequested Format Type (Generation Prompt): type = \"mcq\". Content has 4 populated answer_options. Format matches request.\n\nStep 1 – Student-facing content: Stem: \"Which choice shows a sentence with the correct spaces between each word?\" Options: A) The cat sat on the mat. B) Thecat sat on the mat. C) The cat sat  on the mat. D) The cat sat on the mat . Answer key: A. Explanation (post-attempt): supports A.\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- ISSUE1 (clarity_precision): Stem says \"correct spaces between each word.\" Option D has correct spacing between words, but an extra space before the period. Under a literal reading, D also satisfies the requirement (correct spacing between words), making two answers arguably correct (A and D). The explanation adds an extra requirement (no extra spaces before punctuation) that is not stated in the stem. This ambiguity can change how a student answers.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key = A. Explanation matches options. No mismatches detected.\nChecklist B1 (Answer Giveaway): Practice/assessment item; no pre-attempt giveaways. Pass.\nChecklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No external stimulus.

The double space in C is intentional as a distractor.\n\nMetric scoring mapping: factual_accuracy=1.0 (A is correct; no contradictions), educational_accuracy=1.0 (assesses intended skill; no giveaway), curriculum_alignment=1.0 (aligned to RF.K.1.C), clarity_precision=0.0 (ISSUE1), specification_compliance=1.0 (no applicable spec; MCQ format matched), reveals_misconceptions=1.0 (distractors map to common spacing errors), difficulty_alignment=1.0 (medium is reasonable under Scenario 3), passage_reference=1.0 (N/A), distractor_quality=1.0 (parallel and plausible; multiple-correct risk stems from stem ambiguity rather than distractor construction per se), stimulus_quality=1.0 (no stimulus), mastery_learning_alignment=1.0 (requires analysis of print concepts), localization_quality=1.0 (neutral and age-appropriate).\n\nOverall score rule: C=0 (no failures in factual or educational), N=1 (clarity_precision).

Generation prompt indicates type = mcq; item includes 4 populated choices → compliant with prompt.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (commit list before scoring):\nISSUE1 (Factual Accuracy): Multiple options are also high-frequency sight words, but the item keys only A.\n- Problematic content: Options B “go” and D “want” (and arguably C “home”) can be considered high-frequency words on widely used lists (e.g., Fry 1st 100 includes “go”; Dolch Primer includes “want”; “home” is frequent in early high-frequency corpora/Fry 2nd 100). The stem asks generally, “Which choice is a high-frequency sight word?” without specifying a particular list. Thus, more than one option is arguably correct. The explanation’s reliance on the example list in the standard (“the, of, to, you, she, my, is, are, do, does”) does not constrain the task for students.\n- Why it violates the metric: MCQ correctness depends on a single unambiguously correct choice. Labeling only A as correct is factually questionable because other options also fit the category “high-frequency sight word.”\n\nISSUE2 (Mastery Learning Alignment): Pure recall with no reasoning/application.\n- Problematic content: Stem: “Which choice is a high‑frequency sight word?” Students can answer by recalling memorized sight-word lists; no application, evidence use, or reasoning is required.\n- Why it violates the metric: Per the rubric, items that are pure recall of a memorized fact with no computation/reasoning fail Mastery Learning Alignment.\n\nChecklist A – Field Consistency: The key and explanation match option A and mention the standard’s example list. No field mismatch errors. The flaw is substantive (multiple correct answers), not a metadata mismatch.\nChecklist B – Answer Giveaway: No pre-attempt giveaways; no hints or reveal text shown. Pass.\nChecklist C – Diction/Typo: Clear, age-appropriate language; no merged words or confusing symbols. Pass.\n\nStep 3 – Metric scoring: See individual metric fields.\n\nStep 4 – Overall score calculation: Critical metric failures C=1 (factual_accuracy). Non-critical failures N=1 (mastery_learning_alignment). Per rules, overall must be in 0.70–0.84. Given a critical correctness flaw that materially undermines the item, choose the lower half → 0.73.\n\nStep 5 – Self-consistency check: Each identified issue maps to exactly one metric (ISSUE1→factual_accuracy; ISSUE2→mastery_learning_alignment). Other metrics pass with supporting rationale.\n",

Which word in the sentence is a sight word we learned: the, of, to, you, she, my, is, are, do, does?” with only one such word present), or by having them identify the printed word that matches a spoken prompt within the sentence."

Scenario 3 applied: using general grade-level expectations for K ELA—an “easy” item should involve simple, concrete cause/effect with clear, short sentences and familiar vocabulary.\n\nAssessment Boundaries: None provided.

Inferred objective: With prompting/support, identify/describe the connection (cause/effect) between two ideas in short informational statements.\n\nCommon Misconceptions: Not provided. General expectations used—children may reverse causality, think events are unrelated, or overgeneralize.\n\nItem Specifications: None provided.

Standard Evaluation Process:\nStep 1 – Gather info: Student-facing content includes a short passage and an MCQ asking for the connection between Sam putting on his coat and snow beginning to fall; options A–D. Metadata marks correct answer as A and provides a rationale consistent with the passage.\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- No issues identified.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key = A matches explanation; explanation references weather cues in passage; options listed match explanation content.\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway): No explicit answer visible in student-facing stem/options; solution only in metadata → no giveaway.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No merged words, stray symbols, or grammar issues that would confuse students.\n\nC.

Description: “With prompting and support, describe the connection between two individuals, events, ideas, or pieces of information in a text.”\n\nDifficulty Definitions: None provided in curriculum context. Scenario 3 applied: using general grade-level expectations. Medium at K for identifying a relationship from an explicitly stated short passage is reasonable.\n\nAssessment Boundaries: None provided. Documented: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n\nLearning Objectives: None explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Identify and describe the relationship/connection between two people in a brief informational-like text with support.\n\nCommon Misconceptions: None provided. Using general pedagogy: Kindergarteners may confuse relationship labels (friend vs sibling/classmate) or focus on single actions rather than the overall relationship.\n\nItem Specifications: None provided. Generation prompt specified type: \"mcq\". Format Validation: answer_options populated with 4 choices; compliant.\n\nStep 1 Summary: Student-facing content includes a short passage about Sam and Lily and a multiple-choice question asking for the connection between them. Options A–D provided; labeled correct answer A. No images.\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- ISSUE1 (distractor_quality): “B. Sam and Lily are siblings who argue at the park.” / “C. Sam and Lily are strangers who watch each other from far away.” / “D. Sam and Lily are classmates who study math in the park.” These introduce details that contradict or are unrelated to the passage (“friend,” “played together,” “shared a snack”), making them implausible distractors for diagnosing partial understanding.\n- ISSUE2 (reveals_misconceptions): Same options (B, C, D) do not align with common, targeted confusions for RI.K.3 (e.g., mislabeling friend as sibling while keeping consistent actions, or focusing on an event but missing relationship). As written, they are obviously off, limiting diagnostic value.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key A matches passage; explanation matches. No mismatches.\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway): None; no pre-attempt giveaways.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No merged words or confusing symbols. Clear, age-appropriate language.\n\nScoring Mechanics: Critical metrics (factual_accuracy, educational_accuracy) both pass. Non-critical failures: distractor_quality and reveals_misconceptions (N=2). Overall must be 0.75–0.84.

Using Scenario 3: For K RI.K.7, “Easy” = simple, direct identification of what an illustration shows that directly matches simple text/description with highly distinct distractors.\n\nAssessment boundaries: None provided. Learning objectives: Not listed; inferred objective is to recognize what an illustration shows and connect it to the sentence. Common misconceptions: None provided; general expectation is that some students may choose unrelated but familiar animals/scenes. Item specifications: None provided.\n\nGeneration prompt format check: Requested type = mcq. The content includes 4 populated answer options with a single correct key. Format compliance passes.\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- Checklist A (Field consistency): Correct answer key A matches option text and explanation; no mismatches.\n- Checklist B1 (Giveaway): This is a practice/assessment MCQ. The stem describes the illustration (“shows a bear holding a pot of honey”), and option A repeats this. For K-level RI.K.7, using a description of the illustration is expected scaffolding; it does not inappropriately reveal an answer beyond the intended skill of matching picture content to description. Therefore, not an inappropriate giveaway.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus quality): No image is present, but the item does not direct the student to “look at the image above/below.” Instead, it describes what the illustration shows. No contradiction or misleading stimulus.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): No typos. Vocabulary (“illustration,” “depicts”) is somewhat advanced for K but not ambiguous; clarity remains sufficient.\n\nNo issues identified. All metrics pass.\n\nDeterministic overall: With C=0, N=0 → range 0.85–1.0. Item is sound but not exceptional → choose 0.95.",

Curriculum Data Usage Documentation\n- Confidence Level: SOFT (from provided curriculum context)\n- Standard Identification: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.K.7 – With prompting and support, describe the relationship between illustrations and the text in which they appear (e.g., what person, place, thing, or idea in the text an illustration depicts).\n- Difficulty Definitions: None provided in Curriculum API/context → Scenario 3 (no definitions). I apply typical K ELA expectations: “hard” would require integrating text-image details with close distractors; “easy” would be straightforward identification of the matching person/thing.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided.\n- Learning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Identify how an illustration relates to text (match the person/thing/action depicted to the text description).\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided. Using general pedagogy: students may focus on any object in the illustration rather than the subject referenced in text (duck vs frog/fish/lily pad).\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Generation prompt explicitly requests type: \"mcq\"; content includes populated answer_options → format type matches.\n\nB. Standard Evaluation Process\nStep 2 – Issues (committed before scoring):\n- ISSUE1 (factual_accuracy): Snippet: Option A: \"A duck walking on the water’s surface\" and explanation: \"this choice directly matches the person (duck) and action from the text.\" Problem: The text says “The duck waddles across the pond.” \"Waddles\" typically means walking on land with short, swaying steps; across a pond suggests swimming or movement on water, not \"walking on the water’s surface.\" The explanation claims the action matches, but the action in A (“walking on the water’s surface”) is not supported by the text and is biologically implausible. There’s also no description of actions in the provided illustration description (only which objects appear), so asserting action-match is inconsistent with the given information.\n- ISSUE2 (stimulus_quality): Snippet: \"The accompanying illustration shows a duck, a frog, a lily pad, and a fish.\" Problem: The item bundle provides no image (image_url: []), yet the stem explicitly references an accompanying illustration. This contradicts the prompt and may confuse students—stimulus referenced but absent.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): The stated answer key is A and the explanation ties correctness to person and action alignment. However, given the stem-provided info (only objects listed), claiming action alignment is inconsistent. → Factual Accuracy issue already captured as ISSUE1.\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway): No pre-attempt answer reveal. Explanation is metadata. No giveaway.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No merged non-words or confusing symbols. Language is somewhat advanced for K (\"accompanying illustration\"), but still clear as a singular meaning; not ambiguous.\n\nC. Deviation Justification: None needed; used provided (limited) curriculum context. For difficulty, Scenario 3 applied due to no definitions.\n\nScoring mechanics: Critical metric failures: factual_accuracy = 0.0 (C=1). Non-critical failures: stimulus_quality = 0.0 (N=1).

Curriculum Data Usage Documentation:\n- Confidence Level: SOFT (inferred from content)\n- Standard Identification: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.K.1 (With prompting and support, ask and answer questions about key details in a text.)\n- Difficulty Definitions: Not provided in curriculum context → Scenario 3 (create our own difficulty bar appropriate to K ELA RL.K.1)\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided → cannot enforce specific boundaries\n- Learning Objectives: Not provided → inferred objective: answer a question about a key detail (location) from a brief literary text\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided → evaluate distractors using general pedagogy (mixing up details/subjects; selecting background-knowledge options instead of text-based evidence)\n- Item Specifications: None provided → no hard format requirements to enforce\n\nB. Standard Evaluation Process:\nStep 1 – Read/Gather: Student-facing content includes a short 3-sentence passage and a question asking for the location where Tom climbs after swimming, with 4 MC options (A–D). No images. Metadata includes the answer key (A) and a brief explanation; these are not student-visible pre-attempt.\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): The labeled correct answer A (“onto a big leaf”) directly matches the passage text “After swimming, Tom climbs onto a big leaf.” The explanation is consistent with both the passage and the correct option. No mismatches.\n- Checklist B1 (Answer Giveaway, practice/assessment): The answer key appears only in metadata; there is no visible giveaway in the stem/options. No worked-example reasoning pre-answer. Pass.\n- Checklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No external stimulus. N/A.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): Grammar and phrasing are clear. No merged non-words or stray symbols.\n\nNo issues identified across metrics.\n\nC.

This item requires locating a specific detail with the temporal condition and distinguishing Tom’s action from the frog’s action. That places it at least Medium, plausibly Hard for K. There is no ≥2-grade-level mismatch; thus it passes difficulty alignment.\n\nDeterministic Overall Scoring: C=0 (no critical metric failures), N=0 (no non-critical failures) ⇒ allowed range 0.85–1.0.

Using Scenario 3 assessment per rules: apply typical K ELA expectations—recognizing behaviors that show purposeful engagement during group reading; selecting the example that includes prediction with justification and attentive listening is appropriate and not beyond grade-level cognitive demand when read aloud.\n\nAssessment Boundaries: None provided. Documented: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n\nLearning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Identify and model behaviors that demonstrate active, purposeful engagement and comprehension during group reading (e.g., making predictions with rationale and listening to peers).

Using general pedagogy: students may confuse setting details (meadow vs forest), mix agents in the event (who found/shared), or omit one character.\n- Item Specifications: None provided. Documenting: No Item Specifications provided.\n- Requested Format Type (Generation Prompt): Request specifies type “mcq”. Verification: answer_options populated with 4 choices → compliant.\n\nStandard Evaluation Process:\nStep 2 – Issues (STRUCTURED):\n- ISSUE1 (passage_reference): Snippet: “Which choice correctly lists the main characters, the setting, and the major event in the story about Sam the squirrel?” Problem: The item references “the story about Sam the squirrel,” but no passage/story or link is provided in the student-facing content. Students cannot access the necessary context within this item bundle to answer. Violates passage_reference metric (requires passage/context when referenced).\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency):\n- Answer key = A; explanation references A’s details and matches options. No mismatches between fields/options.\n\nChecklist B1 (Answer Giveaway Check):\n- This is a practice/assessment-style MCQ. No student-visible giveaway; the correct answer appears only in metadata (answer key/explanation), not in the stem/options as a reveal.\n\nChecklist B2 (Stimulus Quality Check):\n- No image or passage provided. Absence alone is not a stimulus-quality failure; instead, it triggers passage_reference failure because the stem references a story not included.\n\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo Check):\n- No merged non-words or confusing symbols. Wording is clear and unambiguous for teachers/assisted K learners.\n\nScoring mechanics:\n- Critical metrics (factual_accuracy, educational_accuracy) both pass.\n- One non-critical failure: passage_reference = 0.0.\n- Overall must be in 0.75–0.84 range (C=0, N=1). Chosen 0.82 (upper half) since the single failure is fixable by including the passage.\n",

Documenting: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n- Learning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Recognize which sentence provides additional descriptive detail about a familiar place (playground).\n- Common Misconceptions: Not provided.

Scenario 3 applied: using general expectations for K ELA; a “medium” item would require checking multiple criteria (drawing, dictating, writing, naming topic, giving information) across options.\n\nAssessment Boundaries: None provided. Documenting: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n\nLearning Objectives: Not explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Identify an example that combines drawing, dictating, and writing to produce an informative text that names the topic and provides information.\n\nCommon Misconceptions: None provided. General pedagogical assessment: Students may conflate “naming the topic” with having a title only; may overlook one modality (drawing/dictating) or the information requirement.\n\nItem Specifications: None provided.\n\nRequested Format Type (Generation Prompt): type = mcq. The content includes populated answer_options (A–D); matches requested type.\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\nISSUE1 (Factual Accuracy): Snippet: Option D: “A picture of a green tree, the child dictated: ‘Trees have leaves and give shade.’ The child wrote the sentence but did not include a title naming the topic.” Stem requires: “using drawing, dictating, and writing … that names the topic and supplies some information.” Option D includes drawing, dictation, writing, names the topic within the sentence (“Trees …”), and supplies information (“have leaves and give shade”). However, the answer key labels only A as correct and the explanation says other options each miss at least one required element, treating “no title” as failing to “name the topic.” The stem does not require a title; naming can be achieved in the sentence. Therefore, D also satisfies the stem, creating a field mismatch: multiple correct choices vs single keyed answer. Primary metric: factual_accuracy.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Mismatch found between stem criteria and explanation/key regarding Option D’s validity → factual_accuracy issue recorded.\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway): No pre-attempt giveaways. Key and rationale are metadata only.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No typos or merged words detected.\n\nMetric scoring mapping: factual_accuracy = 0.0 (due to miskey/mismatch). All other metrics pass based on content.\n\nDifficulty Alignment (Scenario 3 reasoning): For K-level, evaluating multiple explicit criteria across examples is appropriate as “medium.” Students must check presence of all modalities and topic naming/information—more than simple recall.\n\nSelf-consistency: One critical fail (factual_accuracy).

The item asks students to choose a revision that responds to a peer suggestion by adding a detail, which aligns with W.K.5: “With guidance and support from adults, respond to questions and suggestions from peers and add details to strengthen writing as needed.”\n\nDifficulty Definitions: None provided in curriculum context (all unspecified). Using Scenario 3: applying general expectations. For K Writing W.K.5, an “easy” item would involve a single, concrete decision showing an added detail; this item fits.\n\nAssessment Boundaries: None provided. Documenting: No Assessment Boundaries available.\n\nLearning Objectives: None explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Recognize and select a sentence revision that adds a relevant detail per peer feedback.\n\nCommon Misconceptions: None provided. Inferred likely misconceptions: (1) repeating the same sentence with no added detail, (2) adding an unrelated detail (appearance) instead of about the action, (3) changing the action rather than elaborating it. Distractors map to these.\n\nItem Specifications: None provided. Generation prompt requested type: \"mcq\". Validation: POPULATED answer_options (4 choices) → compliant.\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\n- No issues identified.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): The labeled correct answer is A; explanation supports A; all options match references. No mismatches.\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway): Item is a practice/assessment MCQ; no pre-attempt answer reveal; no giveaway.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No merged words/typos; grammar clear. Slightly advanced phrase “strengthen his writing,” but not ambiguous.\n\nMetric-by-metric notes:\n- Factual Accuracy: A (“The dog barks loudly.”) directly adds a detail about the barking; explanation consistent. No contradictions.\n- Educational Accuracy: Targets responding to peer suggestion and adding relevant detail. Appropriate for K with guidance; no giveaways.\n- Curriculum Alignment: Strongly aligned to W.K.5 via scenario of peer suggestion and adding detail.\n- Clarity & Precision: Prompt clearly states the task. While “strengthen his writing” is higher-register for K, the question’s core (“add a detail about what the dog is doing”) is explicit; no ambiguity.\n- Spec Compliance: Requested MCQ; 4 options present; no conflicting specs.\n- Reveals Misconceptions: Distractors map to common errors: B (no change), C (irrelevant detail), D (changes action instead of adding detail).\n- Difficulty Alignment: Single-step identification with very simple sentences; appropriate as Easy for K.\n- Passage Reference: N/A.\n- Distractor Quality: Plausible, parallel simple sentences; not obviously telegraphed beyond the intended skill.\n- Stimulus Quality: No stimulus.\n- Mastery Learning: Requires applying the idea of adding a relevant detail; diagnostic value present.\n- Localization: Neutral, age-appropriate.\n\nOverall range rule: C=0, N=0 → allowable overall 0.85–1.0.

For K ELA W.K.8, “hard” would typically involve longer text, non-exact wording, or closely confusable details requiring sustained attention and comparison; “easy” would be direct, exact recall from a very short sentence with simple, concrete nouns.\n- Assessment Boundaries: None provided. Documented: No Assessment Boundaries provided.\n- Learning Objectives: None explicitly provided. Inferred objective: Recall information from a provided source (the short passage) to answer a question by selecting the matching set of foods.\n- Common Misconceptions: None provided.

Documented: No Item Specifications provided.\n- Requested Format Type (generation prompt): type = mcq.

Which choice correctly lists the three foods…?”. The item is straightforward exact-recall from a one-sentence source with clearly distinct, concrete nouns; distractors each change one food. For K-level, this aligns more with easy recall, not “hard”.\n- Checklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key A matches options and explanation; no mismatches.\n- Checklist B (Answer Giveaway): B1: Not a giveaway. The task explicitly assesses recall from provided text; including the information in the stem is necessary and typical for W.K.8. B2: No stimulus present.\n- Checklist C (Diction/Typo): No merged words, grammar issues, or confusing symbols.\n\nMetric scoring based on issues:\n- Only difficulty_alignment has a concrete issue (0.0). All other metrics have no identified issues (1.0).\n\nDeterministic overall scoring:\n- C (critical fails: factual_accuracy, educational_accuracy) = 0\n- N (non-critical fails) = 1 (difficulty_alignment)\n- Overall must be in 0.75–0.84.
