The past tense of ‘say’ is spelled with ‘ai’ representing the /e/ sound, which does not follow typical phonetic patterns for that sound.”\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\nISSUE1 (factual_accuracy): Problematic snippet: “with ‘ai’ representing the /e/ sound.” In American English, “said” is pronounced /sɛd/; the vowel is the short e sound /ɛ/, not /e/ (which is not the target in this word). The point that it’s irregular is correct, but the phoneme label is inaccurate. This is in the explanation (a supporting field), which must be accurate per rubric.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Correct answer B matches options; explanation generally aligns with intent. Only the phoneme notation is inaccurate. \nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway): None; explanation is metadata shown post-attempt; no giveaways in stem/options. \nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): Student-facing text is clear; distractors are intentionally misspelled; no merged words or confusing symbols.\n\nStep 3 – Metric scoring mapping: factual_accuracy=0.0 due to ISSUE1; all other metrics 1.0 (meets intent, clear, aligned, plausible distractors, appropriate difficulty, etc.).\n\nStep 4 – Overall per rules: C=1 (factual_accuracy), N=0 → overall must be 0.70–0.84.
