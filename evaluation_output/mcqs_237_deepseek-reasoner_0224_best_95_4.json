This nectar is carried back to the hive where worker bees turn it into sweet honey. More importantly, as bees move between flowers, tiny grains of pollen stick to their fuzzy bodies. When they visit the next flower, some pollen rubs off, fertilizing the plant. This process, called pollination, allows plants to produce fruits, vegetables, and seeds. Many foods we eat, like apples, blueberries, and almonds, depend on bee pollination. Honeybees live in large families called colonies, with one queen bee laying eggs and thousands of worker bees doing different jobs. Sadly, honeybee numbers have been dropping in recent years. Scientists think pesticides, diseases, and loss of wildflowers might be causing this. If bees disappear, it could make it harder to grow lots of our favorite foods. That's why people are working to protect bees by planting bee-friendly gardens and using fewer chemicals.\n\nWhich option correctly identifies the main idea of the passage and explains how a key detail supports it?",

    "question": "Read this passage about the life cycle of a monarch butterfly:\n\n\"Monarch butterflies change in a process called metamorphosis. First, the adult butterfly lays tiny eggs on a milkweed plant. After about four days, the eggs hatch into larvae, which are caterpillars. The caterpillars eat milkweed leaves, and this food helps them grow quickly. Then, each caterpillar forms a chrysalis. Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar transforms into a butterfly. Finally, the new butterfly breaks out and flies away.\"\n\nWhich choice best describes the relationship between the stages using time-order and cause/effect words?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "First the butterfly lays eggs, then the eggs hatch into caterpillars. Because the caterpillars eat milkweed, they grow quickly. Next, they form a chrysalis, and after transforming inside, the butterfly finally emerges.",

      "C": "The butterfly lays eggs that hatch into caterpillars. The caterpillars eat leaves and grow.",
      "D": "The passage explains how butterflies are different from other insects."
