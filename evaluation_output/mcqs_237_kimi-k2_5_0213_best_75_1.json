Farmers drill small holes into the trees and hang buckets to collect this liquid. However, the sap is mostly water—about 98 percent! To make syrup, the water must be removed. Farmers pour the sap into large pans over a very hot fire. As the water evaporates, the sap becomes thicker and sweeter. It takes about 40 gallons of sap to make just one gallon of syrup.

Floating on their backs, they crack open sea urchins with rocks, keeping the spiny population in check. If sea otters disappeared, urchins would multiply rapidly and devour the kelp, turning lush forests into bare ocean floors called \"urchin barrens.\" The loss of kelp would endanger hundreds of species that rely on the fronds for shelter and food.

    "question": "Read the story:\n\nThe Last Sketch\n\nMaya pressed her charcoal pencil against the rough paper, but her lines kept crumbling into gray dust. The old oak tree outside her window had stood in the schoolyard for two hundred years, the librarian had said, but today it looked different. Chainsaws buzzed like angry bees in the distance, and a sharp scent of sawdust drifted through the open window.\n\nShe had drawn this tree every Tuesday since September—its gnarled roots gripping the soil like knobby fingers, the way its lowest branch dipped toward the grass like an invitation to climb. Now bright yellow tape circled the trunk, and workers in orange vests measured the fence line with silver tapes that glinted in the sun.\n\nMaya flipped to a fresh page. Her hand moved quickly, not trying for perfection anymore, just capturing the way afternoon light filtered through the jagged leaves. She sketched the dark hollow where a crow had nested last spring, the patch of bark rubbed smooth by generations of swinging children.\n\nWhen the final bell rang, she tucked the drawing carefully into her folder. Outside, the chainsaws had fallen silent. A single worker sat on the concrete curb, head in his hands, turning a splinter of wood no bigger than a pencil between his fingers. Maya walked over and placed her sketch on the bench beside him. \"So we don't forget,\" she whispered. He looked up, nodded slowly, and slipped the drawing into his tool belt before standing to finish his work.\n\nWhich statement best shows a deep understanding of the story?",

She watched her grandmother create bright, intricate tapestries, but when Maya first sat at the loom, her threads tangled and her patterns looked lopsided. Eager for quick results, Maya asked her grandmother for the magic shuttle that would weave perfect cloth instantly. The grandmother handed Maya a smooth, plain wooden shuttle and said, \"Work with this for one full moon.\" Maya grumbled, yet she returned to the loom each morning. At first, her cloth had gaps and loose strands. By the third week, the edges grew straighter and the colors blended evenly. On the thirtieth day, Maya noticed her fingers moved with a steady rhythm, and the cloth emerging was strong and bright. Her grandmother smiled. \"The shuttle was only wood.

We placed three pots on the sunny windowsill. Each pot had the same amount of soil and three seeds. Pot A sat in silence all day. Pot B played soft piano music for four hours each morning. Pot C played drum sounds for the same time. By Friday, the seedlings in Pot B were two inches tall and bright green. The seedlings in Pot C were only half an inch tall and had pale spots on their leaves. The seedlings in Pot A grew one inch and looked healthy. Mrs. Lee told us that plants might respond to vibrations, but we need to collect more data.

      "C": "Write all four pieces in one hour on Monday without stopping to research or revise anything.",
      "D": "Spend five days perfecting the thank-you letter with research about firefighting, and write the science report in 20 minutes on Friday."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because it assigns an extended time frame of five days—including research, drafting, and revising—to the complex science report, while assigning shorter, single-sitting or single-day time frames to the math card, thank-you letter, and journal entry. This demonstrates routine writing across different time frames for various purposes and audiences.",
