The described illustration (bear under tree roots, snow above) coherently supports option B.

Minor potential wording nuance (“illustration” vs “description”) does not create ambiguity about the task.\n- Distractor Quality: A (cave) is text-plausible but not supported by the illustration; C (burrow) is a common animal-home misconception; D (nest) is implausible for bears but recognizably different—overall reasonable set for Grade 3. Choices are grammatically parallel and similar in length/specificity.\n- Stimulus Quality: The textual depiction is concise and directly relevant; no contradictions or distractions.\n- Difficulty Alignment: No difficulty definitions provided; applying Scenario 2. For Grade 3 RI.3.7, a medium item reasonably requires integrating a short text with an illustration to choose the best-supported option. Cognitive demand is appropriate (simple integration/selection).\n- Mastery Learning: Requires evidence-based reasoning from both stimuli, not mere recall.\n- Localization: Neutral, age-appropriate context.\n\nScores: No issues across metrics; all binary metrics = 1.0.

Salt water supports diverse marine life is accurate.
