No merged words or stray symbols.\nNo issues identified.\n\nMetric notes:\n- Factual accuracy: The stem establishes benchmarks “used for this assessment,” so numeric thresholds are internally consistent; correct option logically follows.\n- Educational accuracy: Directly targets RF.3.4.B’s components (accuracy, rate, expression) and “successive readings” is reflected with “On both readings.”\n- Curriculum alignment: Strong alignment to RF.3.4.B.\n- Clarity: Unambiguous; boundary terms do not create edge-case confusion in provided options.\n- Distractors: Plausible and diagnostic (accuracy below 95; over-fast WPM; too-slow/choppy; monotone expression).\n- Difficulty alignment: No spec difficulty definitions; applying general bar: requires applying given thresholds and interpreting expression—appropriate for Grade 3 and plausibly “hard” due to multi-criterion filtering and vocabulary (e.g., monotone), but not ≥2 grades off.\n- Mastery: Requires applying criteria, not mere recall.\n- Localization: Neutral, appropriate.\nOverall: No metric fails. Provide minor improvement suggestions for overall score <1.0: clarify inclusivity of WPM bounds and define “monotone” in kid-friendly terms.",
