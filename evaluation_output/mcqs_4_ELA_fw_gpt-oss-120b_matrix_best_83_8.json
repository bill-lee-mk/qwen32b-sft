When the eggs hatch, the caterpillars (also called larvae) spend several weeks eating the milkweed, growing larger each day.

Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar changes into a beautiful orange and black butterfly.\n\nWhen the adult butterfly emerges, it feeds on nectar from many kinds of flowers.

On December 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, they made the first powered, controlled flight. The airplane had a 12‑horsepower engine that turned two propellers. To keep the aircraft stable, the Wright brothers added a movable rudder at the back, which allowed the pilot to steer left or right. They also designed wing‑warping wires that could twist the wings to control roll. Stability was a major challenge because earlier attempts at flight often crashed when the aircraft tipped. By using a movable rudder, the Wright brothers could correct the plane’s direction quickly. During the first flight, Orville piloted the Flyer for 12 seconds, covering 120 feet.\n\nWhich choice best explains why the Wright brothers added a movable rudder to the Wright Flyer?",

I didn't notice the dark clouds gathering overhead. By the time I reached the school parking lot, it started to drizzle, and soon the drizzle turned into a heavy rain. I was already wearing my new sneakers, which got soaked through, and I didn't have a raincoat or an umbrella. My shoes squelched all day, and my friends laughed when I walked in with soggy socks.

When we recycle paper, we save trees that would otherwise be cut down. In fact, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that recycling paper can save up to 60 percent of the energy needed to make new paper. Second, recycling reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, which lessens soil and water contamination. For example, recycling aluminum cans saves 95 percent of the energy required to produce new aluminum from raw ore.
