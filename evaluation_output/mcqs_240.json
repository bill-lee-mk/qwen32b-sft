    "answer_explanation": "Option C is correct because the phrase 'as he stared at the approaching storm' provides the key context clue.

Their airplane, the Wright Flyer, flew for 12 seconds and traveled 120 feet near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This event marked the beginning of the aviation age. The brothers were bicycle mechanics who used their knowledge of balance and control to solve the problem of flight.\n\n**Passage 2: The Wright Brothers' Method**\nBefore their famous flight, the Wright brothers spent years experimenting with gliders. They built a wind tunnel to test wing shapes and developed a system to control an aircraft in three dimensions: roll, pitch, and yaw. Their breakthrough was not just the engine but their understanding of how to steer and stabilize a flying machine.

He held it up so the last of the sun caught its flecks of silver. For a moment, he felt the mountain’s old strength and the creek’s endless patience, all in the palm of his hand.
