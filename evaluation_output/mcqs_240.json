    "question": "Read the passage about recycling:\n\n\"Recycling is essential for protecting our environment. First, recycling reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills. When we recycle paper, plastic, and glass, these materials don't pile up in landfills. Second, recycling saves natural resources. Making new paper from recycled materials uses less water and energy than making paper from trees. Third, recycling helps fight climate change by reducing pollution from manufacturing.
