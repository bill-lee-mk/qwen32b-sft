    "question": "Read the paragraph.\n\n\"When a caterpillar is ready to become a butterfly, it first attaches itself to a leaf or twig. Then it sheds its skin to reveal a hard protective case called a chrysalis. Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar's body breaks down into a soupy liquid. Special cells called imaginal discs use this liquid to build the wings, antennae, and other parts of an adult butterfly. After several weeks, the chrysalis becomes transparent, and the butterfly emerges.\"\n\nWhich option best describes the relationship between these events using time, sequence, and cause/effect language?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The butterfly emerges first, then the caterpillar attaches itself, which causes the chrysalis to become transparent before the body breaks down.",
      "B": "After attaching itself, the caterpillar sheds its skin to form a chrysalis; inside, its body breaks down, providing material for imaginal discs to rebuild it into a butterfly, which finally emerges when the chrysalis turns transparent.",
      "C": "The caterpillar's body breaks down before it attaches to a twig, so the imaginal discs build the butterfly parts, and then the chrysalis forms after the butterfly emerges.",
      "D": "The chrysalis becomes transparent immediately after the caterpillar attaches itself, causing the body to break down slowly while the butterfly parts are built over several weeks before emergence."

    "question": "Read the passage below.\n\n**Passage:** The Arctic fox is a remarkable survivor in one of Earth's harshest environments. Its thick, white winter coat provides camouflage against the snow and excellent insulation against temperatures that can drop to -50°C. In summer, its fur turns brown or gray to blend with the tundra's rocks and plants. Arctic foxes have furry soles on their feet, which act like snowshoes and keep their paws from freezing. They also have a keen sense of hearing that allows them to locate prey, such as lemmings, beneath the snow. These adaptations—camouflage, insulation, specialized feet, and sharp hearing—all work together to help the Arctic fox thrive in the extreme cold of the Arctic.\n\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the passage?",

This choice summarizes the central point that ties all the key details together.
