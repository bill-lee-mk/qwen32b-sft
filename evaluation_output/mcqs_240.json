    "question": "Read the following passage about the life cycle of a butterfly.\n\nButterflies begin their lives as tiny eggs, often laid on the leaves of plants. From these eggs hatch caterpillars, whose main job is to eat and grow. After growing large enough, the caterpillar forms a protective shell called a chrysalis. Inside the chrysalis, an amazing transformation takes place. The caterpillar's body changes completely, and eventually, a beautiful adult butterfly emerges. The butterfly then lays eggs, starting the cycle all over again.\n\nWhich statement best describes the main idea of the passage?",
    "answer": "C",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Caterpillars eat a lot of leaves to grow big and strong.",
      "B": "The chrysalis is a protective shell where the caterpillar changes.",
      "C": "Butterflies go through a series of distinct stages from egg to adult.",
      "D": "Adult butterflies are beautiful insects that can fly."
    },

The passage describes the entire sequence of a butterfly's life—egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, adult—and how this cycle repeats. Option C correctly identifies this overarching process as the central message, which is supported by all the key details in the text.",

    "question": "Read the passage about a seed's growth. Then, answer the question.\n\n**Passage:** A seed needs water to soften its outer shell and begin to sprout. Once the sprout emerges, it uses sunlight to make food through a process called photosynthesis. As the plant grows, its roots spread out to absorb more water and nutrients from the soil. Finally, the plant produces flowers, which can be pollinated to create new seeds.\n\nWhich of the following best describes the relationship between the steps in a seed's growth?",
    "answer": "C",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The steps are a list of facts about plants.",

    "question": "Read the following two passages about the same historical event.\n\n**Passage 1:** The Boston Tea Party was a bold protest by American colonists against British taxes. On December 16, 1773, colonists disguised as Native Americans boarded ships in Boston Harbor and threw chests of tea into the water. This act showed their strong opposition to British rule and was a key step toward the American Revolution.\n\n**Passage 2:** The event known as the Boston Tea Party was a significant act of defiance. In late 1773, protesters, some wearing disguises, destroyed a large shipment of tea owned by the British East India Company. British leaders saw this as a lawless destruction of property and responded with harsh new laws, which angered the colonists further.\n\nWhich statement accurately compares the most important point made by BOTH passages?",

      "A": "Both passages focus mainly on the specific disguises the protesters wore.",

      "D": "Both passages provide detailed information about the British laws that were passed after the event."

    "answer_explanation": "Option C is correct because it identifies the core, shared point across both texts: that the Boston Tea Party was a significant protest that escalated conflict. Passage 1 calls it a 'bold protest' and a 'key step toward the American Revolution.' Passage 2 calls it a 'significant act of defiance' that led to 'harsh new laws' and further anger. This captures the most important comparative point about the event's role in increasing tensions.",
