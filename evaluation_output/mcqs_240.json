His fingers would sometimes fumble on the strings, and the sound would squeak. But he kept going. On the day of the school recital, his hands were sweaty as he walked onto the stage. He took a deep breath, raised his violin, and began to play. When he finished, the audience was silent for a moment before bursting into loud applause.

All its companions had surrendered to the autumn wind days ago, but this one held fast, trembling yet determined. Each morning, Maya would check—still there. Her mother said the leaf was stubborn, but Maya thought it was brave. One frosty dawn, she noticed the leaf's edges had turned gold, and a thin glaze of ice made it sparkle like a tiny jewel.

Anya watched the river for days, noticing how the water flowed around certain rocks. She gathered strong vines and wove them into a net, anchoring it between two large trees on opposite banks.
