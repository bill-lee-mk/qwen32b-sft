      "D": "The sun was setting, so the sky turned orange and the birds returned to their nests."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because it creates a complex sentence with one dependent clause ('As the sun was setting') and one independent clause ('the sky turned orange and the birds returned to their nests'). The subordinating conjunction 'As' establishes the relationship between the events. Option A is a compound sentence using 'and' to join independent clauses. Option C is a simple sentence with a compound predicate. Option D is a compound sentence with two independent clauses joined by 'so'.",

      "A": "Both civilizations built pyramids to honor their leaders, but the Maya also used them for storage.",

      "D": "Neither civilization considered pyramids important; they were just decorative structures."

The passage states the lighthouse had stood for over a century, that the keeper was leaving for the last time, and that he touched the 'cold, worn stone.'

    "question": "A teacher reads the following passage aloud: 'The giant panda is a unique bear native to China. Its diet consists almost entirely of bamboo, which it eats for up to 14 hours a day. Pandas have a special wrist bone that acts like a thumb to help them grip bamboo stalks. Despite being classified as carnivores, they rarely eat meat. Conservation efforts have helped increase their population, but they remain vulnerable due to habitat loss.' After listening, a student says the main idea is that pandas are interesting animals. Which choice best explains why this statement is not the main idea of the passage?",
    "answer": "C",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "It is too general and does not capture the specific focus on panda characteristics and conservation.",
      "B": "It is factually incorrect because the passage says pandas are not interesting.",

      "D": "It only mentions one detail from the passage about pandas eating bamboo."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option C is correct because the student's statement 'pandas are interesting animals' is a subjective opinion, not an objective summary of the main ideas presented in the passage. The passage specifically details pandas' unique diet, physical adaptation for eating bamboo, classification paradox, and conservation status—key points that together form the main idea. Identifying why a given statement fails to capture the main idea requires analyzing how it diverges from the text's central focus, aligning with the hard-level skill of determining main ideas and supporting details from an oral text.",

She played it for her family, her dog, and even the mirror. On the night of the concert, her hands trembled as she walked onto the stage. The bright lights made her blink, but she took a deep breath, raised her bow, and began to play.\"",
    "answer": "C",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The next piece on the program was a duet by two students from the fourth grade.",
      "B": "Suddenly, a loud noise from the back of the auditorium made everyone jump.",
      "C": "When the last note faded, the audience rose in applause, and Maya bowed, feeling proud and relieved that all her hard work had paid off.",
      "D": "Violins have four strings and are played with a bow made of horsehair."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option C is correct because it shows the completion of the performance event (the last note, applause, bowing) and Maya's reflection on her effort, which provides a clear and satisfying ending to the narrative. The other options either introduce new events, unrelated facts, or details that do not conclude the story.",

      "C": "The dog ran fast across the yard.",
      "D": "The dog runned fast across the yard and barked."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option C is correct because it strengthens the writing by correcting the grammatical error in the original sentence.

      "D": "Recess is a time for students to play and relax, which helps them focus better when they return to class."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because it demonstrates writing appropriate to the task (a persuasive letter), purpose (to persuade the principal), and audience (the school principal). It uses a formal salutation, respectful tone, and clearly states the request in a manner suitable for communicating with a school administrator. The other options are less appropriate: Option A is too informal and casual, Option C is demanding and lacks courtesy, and Option D is a general statement rather than a direct opening for a persuasive letter.",

      "D": "I think recycling is good. My family recycles at home. We have a blue bin in the kitchen."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because it directly addresses classmates (audience) with persuasive language and specific reasons to act (purpose), and it is developed as a paragraph appropriate for the task of persuasion.
