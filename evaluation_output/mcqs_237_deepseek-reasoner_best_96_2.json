Upon returning to the hive, they regurgitate the nectar and pass it to other bees. These bees add enzymes that convert the nectar's complex sugars into simpler ones. Next, the bees spread the nectar into honeycomb cells and fan it vigorously with their wings. This fanning action causes water to evaporate, thickening the nectar into honey. Finally, once the honey reaches the right consistency, bees seal the cells with wax to preserve it for future use.\n\nA scientist observes that honey in a beehive is thin and fermenting.

The class talked to the principal and suggested trying a sweeter apple variety. After the change, the amount of apple waste went down. They also set up a compost bin for other food scraps.
