One autumn, the animals needed to gather nuts for the long winter. Finn rushed from tree to tree, snatching nuts but often dropping them in his haste. Squirrel, who was much slower, took her time, placing each nut carefully in her burrow. By sunset, Squirrel had a tidy heap of nuts, while Finn had only a few scattered on the ground.
