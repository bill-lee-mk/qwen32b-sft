    "question": "A student is writing a report about a family vacation. Which choice shows the student recalling information from experiences?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The student looks up information about the vacation spot on a website.",
      "B": "The student writes down what they remember seeing and doing during the vacation.",
      "C": "The student asks a classmate about their own vacation.",
      "D": "The student invents details that did not happen."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because recalling information from experiences involves using one's own memories and observations, such as writing down what was personally seen and done during an event.",
    "difficulty": "easy",

    "question": "Standard W.3.8 requires students to recall information from experiences or gather information from print and digital sources, take brief notes, and sort evidence into provided categories. A student is writing a report on ocean animals and has gathered these notes: 1) From a library book: 'Dolphins use echolocation to find food.' 2) From a website: 'Whales migrate long distances each year.' 3) From personal experience: 'I saw a sea turtle at the aquarium last summer.' The student needs to sort the notes into the categories 'Animal Behaviors' and 'Personal Observations.' Which choice correctly sorts all the notes?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Animal Behaviors: Dolphins use echolocation; Whales migrate. Personal Observations: I saw a sea turtle.",
      "B": "Animal Behaviors: Dolphins use echolocation; I saw a sea turtle. Personal Observations: Whales migrate.",
      "C": "Animal Behaviors: Whales migrate. Personal Observations: Dolphins use echolocation; I saw a sea turtle.",
      "D": "Animal Behaviors: All notes. Personal Observations: None."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because it accurately sorts the notes: dolphin echolocation and whale migration are animal behaviors gathered from information sources, which belong under 'Animal Behaviors,' and seeing a sea turtle is a personal observation recalled from experience, which belongs under 'Personal Observations.' This follows the W.3.8 standard by taking brief notes and sorting evidence into the provided categories.",

    "question": "When writing a report, students should recall information from their own experiences or gather information from sources like books and websites. Alex is working on a project about weather. Which choice best shows Alex following this standard?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Alex only thinks about what he knows from watching the sky and does not check any sources.",
      "B": "Alex visits a kid-safe weather website, writes down key points about rainbows, and remembers helping his dad shovel snow last winter to add a personal story.",
      "C": "Alex copies a full paragraph from a book about clouds without writing any notes or mentioning the source.",
      "D": "Alex guesses what causes thunderstorms without using any experiences or looking up information."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because Alex gathers information from a digital source (the weather website) by taking brief notes and also recalls information from a personal experience (helping his dad shovel snow), which directly aligns with the standard of recalling from experiences or gathering from sources and taking notes.",
