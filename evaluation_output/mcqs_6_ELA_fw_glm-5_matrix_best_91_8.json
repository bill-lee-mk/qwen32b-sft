The sentence would still be complete and grammatically correct without 'herself' ('The author signed copies...'), which is the defining characteristic of intensive pronouns. In contrast, the pronouns in options B and D are reflexive—they are essential to the sentence meaning and cannot be removed.

    "question": "Read the passage:\n\nThe Arctic tern is a small seabird that holds the record for the longest migration of any animal on Earth. Each year, these remarkable birds travel from their breeding grounds in the Arctic to their wintering grounds in the Antarctic and back again—a round trip of approximately 44,000 miles. Scientists have tracked individual terns using lightweight GPS tags, discovering that some birds travel even farther by following winding routes that take advantage of wind patterns. Despite weighing only about four ounces, Arctic terns navigate across vast oceans, endure extreme weather conditions, and face predators such as falcons and skuas. Remarkably, they return to nearly the same nesting site year after year, often within a few feet of their previous nests. Because they spend most of the year in flight and live in regions with extended daylight during breeding and wintering seasons, Arctic terns experience more daylight than any other creature on the planet.\n\nThe passage suggests that Arctic terns possess exceptional navigational abilities.

At the time, few scientists had spent such extended periods studying marine life in its natural habitat. This groundbreaking expedition introduced Earle as a pioneer willing to challenge conventions.\n\nThroughout her career, Earle has illustrated the urgency of ocean conservation through vivid accounts of what she has witnessed. In one striking anecdote, she describes returning to a reef she had studied decades earlier: where once there had been a thriving ecosystem of coral and fish, she found only bleached skeletons and silence. She recounts swimming through areas once teeming with sharks, now empty because of overfishing. These personal stories make the abstract concept of environmental decline impossible to ignore.\n\nEarle elaborates on her message by pointing to specific successes that offer hope. She highlights the creation of marine protected areas around the world, noting that when key regions are shielded from fishing and drilling, ecosystems can recover. She cites the revival of fish populations in certain protected zones as evidence that human intervention can reverse damage, not just cause it.

These underwater ecosystems support approximately 25% of all marine species, despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. For coastal communities around the world, reefs provide food, income from tourism, and protection from storms.\n\n[2] However, rising ocean temperatures are causing widespread coral bleaching. When water becomes too warm, corals expel the algae living in their tissues, turning white and leaving them vulnerable to disease. Scientists have documented mass bleaching events that have destroyed thousands of miles of reef in recent decades.\n\n[3] The loss of coral reefs would have devastating consequences beyond the marine environment. Coastal fisheries would collapse, threatening the food security of millions of people. Tourism industries would suffer, eliminating jobs in island nations that depend on reef-related activities. Additionally, shorelines would become more vulnerable to erosion and storm damage.\n\n[4] Fortunately, researchers are developing innovative solutions to protect remaining reefs. Some teams are breeding heat-resistant coral varieties in laboratories, while others are installing artificial structures that can serve as reef foundations. Marine protected areas are being expanded to reduce additional stressors like pollution and overfishing.\n\n[5] The future of coral reefs depends on both local conservation efforts and global action on climate change. While restoration projects offer hope, they cannot succeed without addressing the root cause of rising temperatures.

    "question": "Read the following passage:\n\nThe Digital Divide in American Schools\n\nWalk into a school in an affluent suburb, and you'll likely see students working on individual tablets, accessing online resources, and collaborating through educational apps. Visit a school in an under-resourced neighborhood just a few miles away, and you might find students sharing outdated textbooks, struggling to complete assignments that require internet access they don't have at home. This disparity isn't just about technology—it's about opportunity. Students without digital access fall behind in research skills, miss out on interactive learning experiences, and enter the job market already at a disadvantage. Some argue that technology companies should step up and donate devices. Others suggest that schools reallocate their budgets. But these solutions ignore the root cause: unequal funding systems that leave some communities perpetually under-resourced. Until we address the fundamental unfairness in how we fund public education, the digital divide will continue to separate those who have from those who don't.\n\nWhich choice best identifies the author's point of view and explains how it is conveyed in the passage?",

First, research from the American Academy of Pediatrics confirms that teenagers' biological clocks make them naturally stay up later and need to sleep later in the morning, meaning early start times conflict with their natural sleep patterns. Second, later start times improve student attendance. A 2014 study of high schools across eight districts found that when schools moved start times to 8:30 AM or later, average daily attendance increased by 12% within the first year. Third, later start times reduce traffic accidents involving teenage drivers. Researchers comparing crash rates in two similar counties found a 13% decrease in the county that had delayed its school start time by one hour. Fourth, later start times improve academic performance. A three-year study of 9,000 students showed that those who started school after 8:30 AM earned higher grades in math, science, and English compared to students at schools with earlier start times.

She wanted to help, but she felt shy and kept walking.\n\nThat night, Maya couldn't stop thinking about Mr. Henderson. She remembered how her grandmother had lived alone before moving to a nursing home. The next day, Maya stopped at Mr. Henderson's house. \"Can I help you with your groceries?\" she asked.\n\nMr. Henderson's face lit up with a smile. \"That would be wonderful,\" he said. As they walked to his door, he told Maya stories about his years as a teacher and the many students he had known. Maya listened with interest.\n\nAfter that day, Maya visited Mr. Henderson every week. She helped with small tasks, and he shared his knowledge about gardening, history, and books.

Her brother Carlos had promised to teach her to skate, but when he got sick that morning, she would have to learn on her own. She stepped onto the ice, her legs wobbling like a newborn deer. Within seconds, she was on her knees.\n\n\"You okay?\" called a girl in a red jacket, zooming past.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" Maya muttered, though her palms stung from the cold.\n\nShe tried again. And again. Each time, the ice seemed to mock her, sending her sprawling.

But then she remembered what her grandmother always said: \"The only way to fail is to stop trying.\"\n\nShe took a deep breath and pushed off again.

Her grandmother's saying—\"The only way to fail is to stop trying\"—reinforces this theme, and Maya's eventual success through persistent effort demonstrates it by the end of the passage.",

The tree had been there since his grandfather was a boy, and its thick branches provided the perfect shady spot. One day, Marcus noticed something troubling—a large crack running up the trunk, and several branches had lost their leaves weeks before autumn should have arrived.\n\n\"Dad, I think the oak tree is dying,\" Marcus said worriedly.\n\nHis father examined the tree and sighed. \"I'm afraid you're right, son. The arborist says it has a disease. We'll have to cut it down before it becomes dangerous.\"\n\nMarcus felt a lump form in his throat. He had climbed that tree, read books under it, and even carved his initials into a low branch. He couldn't imagine the backyard without it.\n\nBut then Marcus had an idea. He carefully collected several acorns that had fallen from the tree and planted them in small pots. He watered them every day and made sure they got plenty of sunlight.\n\nMonths later, tiny green shoots emerged from the soil. Marcus showed them to his father, who smiled proudly. \"You know, your grandfather planted that oak tree when he was about your age,\" his father said. \"Now you're carrying on his legacy.\"\n\nMarcus realized that even though the old tree would be gone, part of it would live on through the new seedlings.

      "D": "Accepting the loss of something you love takes a very long time."

When the beloved oak tree must be cut down, Marcus collects its acorns and plants them, ensuring that new trees will grow. His father's comment about 'carrying on his legacy' and Marcus's final thought that 'part of it would live on through the new seedlings' directly support the theme that endings can give rise to new beginnings that preserve what matters.",

'I should have helped you secure it,' Marcus said quietly. 'I was careless with my own section. Can I help you finish?'\n\nJamie looked up, surprised, then handed him a glue gun.

When the spring rains came gently, the crops flourished and children played along the muddy banks. When the rains came violently, the river swelled and swallowed fields, livestock, and sometimes the unwary. Old Mara had watched this cycle repeat for eighty years, and she had learned to read the river's moods in the color of its waters and the smell of the air.\n\nOne evening, as the villagers celebrated the harvest with music and dancing, Mara noticed the river had turned an unusual shade of brown. She hurried to warn the council, but they dismissed her concerns, too caught up in their festivities to listen to an old woman's fears. That night, the river rose higher than it had in a generation, and by morning, half the village lay underwater.\n\nYears later, the rebuilt village still held festivals by the river, but now they always posted a watcher during celebrations—a tradition born from a night when joy had blinded them to danger.\n\nWhich statement best explains how the final paragraph fits into the overall structure of the passage and contributes to the development of the theme?",

I had memorized my schedule, but now the room numbers blurred together. Why had Mom made me switch schools in the middle of the year? Nobody would want to be friends with the new kid who arrived in February.\n\nWhich choice best explains how the author develops the narrator's point of view as anxious and self-conscious?",
    "answer": "A",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "By revealing the narrator's physical sensations and worried thoughts",
      "B": "By including dialogue between the narrator and other students",
      "C": "By describing how other characters react to the narrator",
      "D": "By comparing the narrator to confident students in the hallway"
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because the author develops the narrator's anxious, self-conscious point of view by sharing the narrator's internal experience—the clammy hands, the worry about appearance, the fear that laughs are directed at them, and the concern about making friends. These details allow readers to understand how the narrator perceives and interprets events through a lens of anxiety and insecurity.",

      "D": "When reading the story, Emma could see the actors performing the scenes."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because it directly contrasts what Emma perceives when watching the video (seeing facial expressions) with what she must do when reading (imagine the expressions).

      "C": "When reading, the student sees the characters' facial expressions change, but when watching the film, the actors do not show any emotion.",
      "D": "When reading, the student hears background music that creates mood, but when watching the film, there is no music or sound to set the tone."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because when reading a text, readers must use their imagination to visualize characters' appearances and to 'hear' their voices in their minds. In contrast, when watching a film adaptation, the viewer directly perceives concrete details through the actors' physical appearance, facial expressions, costumes, and vocal delivery, which provides a specific interpretation of the characters that the reader does not experience when reading the printed text alone.",

    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because it accurately identifies how the two genres differ in their approach to the theme of perseverance. The short story uses the structural elements of narrative fiction—a sequence of events, character development over time, and a clear resolution—to explore the theme.

I strongly believe our school should adopt a later start time, and I have several reasons to support this position. First, the National Sleep Foundation's research demonstrates that teenagers biologically require 8-10 hours of sleep nightly, yet our current 7:00 AM start time forces most students to get only 6-7 hours. Second, three high schools in our own district that implemented 8:30 AM start times documented a 15% increase in average GPAs and a 20% decrease in tardiness within one year, as reported in the district's official evaluation. Third, moving our start time later would create a more positive and welcoming school environment for students and staff alike. Fourth, a survey of 300 students at our school revealed that 82% felt more alert and focused on days when first period began at 9:00 AM for special events.\"\n\nWhich claim in the speaker's argument is NOT supported by reasons or evidence?",

    "question": "Read the following excerpt from an essay about honeybees:\n\n\"Honeybees play a crucial role in agriculture by pollinating crops. In fact, about one-third of the food we eat depends on pollination from bees. Farmers rely on bees to pollinate fruits, vegetables, and nuts such as almonds and apples. Without bees, many of our favorite foods would become scarce and expensive.

      "D": "Maya opened the envelope and read the results. She had worked so hard for this opportunity, and being named an alternate was a bittersweet outcome."
