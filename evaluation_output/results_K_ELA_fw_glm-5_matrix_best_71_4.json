Thus more than one option is literally missing, creating ambiguity about what criterion to use. Quote: “Which choice tells what is MISSING from Liam's story?” → A and D are also missing, not only C.\n- ISSUE2 (distractor_quality): Distractors A and D are factually missing from the story, so they are not actually wrong. This yields multiple correct answers in a single-correct MCQ format, undermining item function.\n\nChecklist A – Field consistency: The answer key = C. Explanation aligns with W.K.3 (reaction missing). Options and explanation are consistent; B is present in the story. No mismatches.\nChecklist B – Answer giveaway: No pre-attempt giveaways. No hints shown.\nChecklist C – Diction/typo: No typos or merged words.\n\nStep 3 – Metric scoring based on issues:\n- factual_accuracy: Pass (no factual errors; C is indeed a missing reaction; B is present).\n- educational_accuracy: Pass (targets the intended standard element – reaction – despite design issues captured under other metrics).\n- clarity_precision: Fail due to ambiguous stem allowing multiple correct interpretations.\n- specification_compliance: No enforceable spec provided; pass by rule.\n- reveals_misconceptions: Pass; B could diagnose inattention to details (since it’s present), though overall distractor design is imperfect.\n- difficulty_alignment: Pass. No explicit difficulty definitions; for K, identifying a missing reaction among details is appropriately challenging, could be “hard.”\n- passage_reference: N/A/pass.\n- distractor_quality: Fail; A and D are also missing, so not clearly incorrect.\n- stimulus_quality: N/A/pass (no stimulus).\n- mastery_learning_alignment: Pass; requires applying knowledge of narrative elements.\n- localization_quality: Pass; neutral, age-appropriate.\n\nStep 4 – Overall: C=0, N=2 → required overall range 0.75–0.84.
