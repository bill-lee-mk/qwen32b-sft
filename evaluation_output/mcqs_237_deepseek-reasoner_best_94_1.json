    "question": "Read the passage below.\n\n**Forest Recycling**\nIn a healthy forest, nothing goes to waste. When leaves fall from trees or plants die, they begin to decay on the forest floor. This decay is carried out by decomposers—tiny living things like fungi, bacteria, and insects. These decomposers feed on the dead material, breaking it down into simpler substances. As they do this, important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are released into the soil. Tree roots then absorb these nutrients, which help new leaves and branches grow. Decomposers also create spaces in the soil, letting air and water reach plant roots. Without this natural recycling, the forest soil would become poor, and plants might struggle to survive.\n\nWhich choice best describes the outcome that would most directly result from a lack of decomposers in the forest?",

Pandas primarily eat bamboo, using their strong jaws and teeth to crush the tough stalks. Interestingly, they have an extra 'thumb' made of bone that helps them hold bamboo. However, pandas face serious threats because their forest homes are being destroyed for farming and cities. This loss of habitat makes it difficult for them to find enough food and safe places to live. To address this, conservationists are establishing nature reserves and working with local communities to protect panda habitats.
