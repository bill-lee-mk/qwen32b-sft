      "D": "The ice cream fell from the child's hand while playing in the park."

    "question": "For decades, educators and child development specialists have emphasized the critical importance of reading aloud to young children. Research conducted by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2014 confirmed that reading aloud to infants and toddlers significantly boosts early brain development, activating the parts of the brain that process narrative, language, and imagination. During these shared reading sessions, children hear a wider range of vocabulary words and complex sentence structures than they encounter in typical everyday conversation. A longitudinal study from the University of California found that children who are read to daily hear nearly 300,000 more words by age five than children who are not read to regularly, giving them a substantial head start in language development when they enter school. Furthermore, reading aloud creates strong emotional bonds between caregivers and children that can positively influence social development for years. When a parent cuddles with a child and reads a story, the child's brain associates the act of reading with comfort, safety, and security. This powerful positive association often leads to a lifelong love of books and a curious approach to learning. Despite these clear and well-documented benefits, a recent national survey revealed that only about half of parents read aloud to their children every day. Leading literacy experts recommend setting aside at least twenty minutes each evening for this activity, noting that consistent exposure to stories improves not only foundational literacy skills but also empathy, as children learn to understand different perspectives and emotions through characters' experiences.\n\nWhich choice from the passage best supports the inference that reading aloud helps strengthen the emotional relationship between parents and children?",

    "question": "The construction of the Panama Canal stands as one of the most ambitious engineering feats in human history, yet its completion required far more than technical ingenuity; it demanded a fundamental shift in scientific understanding and administrative willpower. When the United States took over the project in 1904, they inherited a legacy of catastrophic failure; the French attempt had collapsed after losing an estimated 22,000 workers to disease and facing insurmountable financial ruin. Dr. William Gorgas, the newly appointed chief sanitation officer, faced immediate and fierce skepticism when he insisted that mosquitoes—not “bad air” or miasma—transmitted malaria and yellow fever. Despite ridicule from many seasoned engineers who clung to outdated theories, Gorgas orchestrated an aggressive campaign to eliminate standing water, install screens on windows, and fumigate living quarters with toxic chemicals. Meanwhile, chief engineer John Stevens revolutionized the excavation process by diverting the Chagres River and ordering the construction of a massive, unprecedented railway system solely to haul debris. This method seemed extravagant to critics who favored traditional manual carting, yet it proved essential for moving over 100 million cubic yards of earth. The workforce, composed largely of West Indian laborers, endured grueling twelve-hour shifts in tropical heat, with mortality rates remaining troublingly high even after sanitation improvements reduced disease. Nevertheless, through a relentless combination of medical innovation, logistical restructuring, and sheer human perseverance, the canal opened in 1914, fundamentally altering global maritime trade and demonstrating that infrastructure projects succeed only when they adapt to environmental realities rather than ignore them.\n\nWhich choice provides the best evidence to support the inference that the success of the American canal project depended on challenging established scientific beliefs?",

    "question": "The ancient stands of Douglas fir, having witnessed centuries of climatic oscillations, now face an adversary more relentless than any ice age: the fragmentation of their contiguous habitat. Unlike the catastrophic wildfires that historically cleared swaths of understory—thereby catalyzing the next generation of giants—contemporary logging practices sever the mycorrhizal networks that serve as arboreal neural pathways, disrupting not merely individual specimens but the collective intelligence of the ecosystem. This severance represents more than ecological loss; it constitutes an erasure of biological memory, a silencing of chemical conversations that have persisted since before the Industrial Revolution. Where once the forest functioned as a symphonic collaboration of root and fungus, the mechanized extraction of timber introduces a dissonance that reverberates through generations of seedlings, condemning them to isolated existences devoid of the nutritional subsidies and warning signals that once traveled subterranean highways.\n\nWhich choice best identifies the author's primary claim about the impact of modern forestry practices?",

    "question": "When Johannes Gutenberg introduced the movable-type printing press to Europe around 1440, he could not have predicted the dual transformation he was unleashing. Initially, the invention appeared merely as a mechanical improvement over the slow, laborious process of hand-copying manuscripts. Monastic scribes, who had preserved knowledge for centuries, viewed the device with curiosity, believing it might relieve them of tedious work. However, as printing presses proliferated across major cities within decades, the implications grew more complex. \n\nThe technology undeniably democratized knowledge, enabling texts to reach audiences previously excluded by cost and scarcity. A single printed work could be reproduced hundreds of times, spreading scientific discoveries, religious texts, and literary works to merchants and scholars alike. Yet this same efficiency dismantled centuries-old systems of control. The authority of institutions that had regulated information—churches, universities, and guilds—eroded as independent printers determined what would be published. By the end of the fifteenth century, the landscape of European intellectual life had been irrevocably altered, marked by both unprecedented access to ideas and the destabilization of traditional gatekeepers.\n\nWhich choice best describes how the two central ideas of the passage develop over the course of the text?",
    "answer": "C",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "It suggests that monastic scribes initially resisted the printing press but eventually adapted their methods to incorporate the new technology, focusing solely on the evolution of traditional copying practices.",

    "question": "During the 1930s Dust Bowl, agricultural scientist Hugh Bennett advocated for soil conservation districts to prevent further land degradation. Initially, farmers resisted his ideas, believing that plowing more land would bring economic recovery. However, the devastating black blizzards of 1935—massive dust storms that darkened skies across the Great Plains—created an immediate crisis that forced farmers to reconsider Bennett's proposals. Within months, Congress passed the Soil Conservation Act, establishing the agency Bennett led, and farmers began implementing contour plowing techniques. Bennett's ideas had transformed from fringe theories into federal policy only after the environmental catastrophe made the economic costs of ignoring conservation undeniable.\n\nWhich option best analyzes the interaction between the 1935 dust storms, Hugh Bennett's ideas, and Congressional action?",

Teachers assigned worksheets and reading logs believing that additional practice would solidify classroom learning. Yet mounting evidence suggests this traditional approach may require reevaluation.\n\n[2] Critics point to research indicating that excessive homework correlates with increased stress levels and sleep deprivation among adolescents. Furthermore, they argue that homework often widens the achievement gap, as students from affluent families typically have more resources and parental support to complete assignments than their less privileged peers.\n\n[3] However, defenders of homework maintain that structured assignments outside school hours teach crucial time management and self-discipline. They cite studies showing that moderate, purposeful homework in middle and high school improves retention of complex material and prepares students for the independent study required in college.\n\n[4] Rather than eliminating homework entirely, many educators now advocate for a balanced approach: assigning fewer, more meaningful tasks that account for students' individual circumstances and learning needs.\n\nWhich choice best describes how paragraph 3 functions in the overall structure of the text?",

    "question": "Passage 1 by Maria Vargas:\nSocial media platforms have revolutionized education for teenagers. Online study groups and educational content creators provide free tutoring and resources. A 2022 study showed that 68% of students who used academic hashtags improved their grades. Vargas concludes that social media is an essential learning tool for modern students.\n\nPassage 2 by David Chen:\nSocial media platforms have created a crisis of attention among teenagers. The constant stream of notifications interrupts homework and sleep. A 2022 study found that teens spending over three hours daily on social media were twice as likely to report anxiety. Chen argues that social media poses serious risks to adolescent mental health.\n\nWhich choice best describes how the two authors shape their presentations of information about social media differently?",

    "question": "Passage 1 (Vargas): While artificial intelligence has automated many tasks once performed by humans, history demonstrates that technological revolutions ultimately generate more employment opportunities than they eliminate. Data from the 1990s internet boom reveals that for every administrative role automated, 2.3 new positions emerged in web development and digital services. Similarly, AI systems require extensive human oversight in programming, ethics compliance, and quality assurance. These efficiency gains should be understood not as threats to livelihoods, but as catalysts shifting workers toward creative and interpersonal roles that machines cannot replicate.\n\nPassage 2 (Chen): Recent analyses of artificial intelligence deployment reveal an unprecedented acceleration of workforce displacement that defies historical patterns. Unlike the gradual transition seen during the Industrial Revolution, AI systems have eliminated 40% of entry-level customer service positions within just eighteen months of implementation. Furthermore, retraining programs for displaced workers show success rates below 15%, indicating that affected employees are not transitioning to new sectors but exiting the workforce entirely. When examining these efficiency gains, we must recognize them not as opportunities for creative redirection, but as the systematic dismantling of established career pathways.\n\nWhich choice best describes how the author of Passage 1 (Vargas) and the author of Passage 2 (Chen) shape their presentations of key information about artificial intelligence and employment?",

New machinery increased production efficiency, creating wealth that lifted many families into the middle class. Factories provided steady employment opportunities, and technological breakthroughs laid the groundwork for modern conveniences that improved quality of life.\n\nPassage 2\nThe Industrial Revolution created a nightmare for the working class. Children as young as six worked twelve-hour days in dangerous textile mills. Factory air was thick with toxic coal dust, and safety regulations were virtually nonexistent.

Then answer the question.\n\nThe moment Marcus stepped onto the porch, the humidity wrapped around him like a wet wool blanket—stifling, familiar, inescapable. He had fled this coastal town fifteen years ago, swearing that the salt in the air had been corroding his ambition. Now, standing before the weathered Victorian his mother had left him, he noticed how the jasmine had overtaken the trellis, not destroying it but transforming the wood into something organic and half-alive. Inside, the floorboards still creaked in the same Morse code of complaint. Yet when he opened the piano—untouched, miraculously in tune—the first chord he struck sounded less like music and more like a question he wasn’t ready to answer. He closed the lid not with anger, but with the careful precision of someone sealing a letter he might never mail.\n\nWhich choice best describes Marcus's complex attitude toward his inheritance of the house?",

Which choice best analyzes how these film techniques affect the interpretation of the scene compared to the written story?",

      "A": "The shallow focus and desaturated colors make the background appear cheerful and inviting, contrasting with the text’s mood of uncertainty.",

      "A": "By depicting a large, enthusiastic crowd and omitting the flight’s brevity, the author heightens the sense of collective triumph to underscore the theme of humanity’s boundless potential.",

      "D": "By limiting the flight to exactly 12 seconds, the author generates suspense regarding the mechanical reliability of early aircraft."

      "A": "Schools should begin classes at 9:00 a.m. rather than 8:00 a.m. to improve student health and academic performance. While some administrators argue that later start times would interfere with after-school sports and jobs, research indicates that the benefits to adolescent sleep patterns outweigh these logistical concerns. This essay will first examine the health impacts of sleep deprivation, then analyze data linking rest to academic achievement, and finally address practical implementation strategies.",
      "B": "Starting school at 9:00 a.m. would dramatically improve student health and academic performance. Teenagers need more sleep than adults, and early start times cause chronic sleep deprivation. Additionally, test scores rise when students are well-rested. Therefore, districts must change their schedules to support student success.",

When a forager bee returns to the hive after discovering a rich nectar source, it performs a figure-eight pattern on the vertical honeycomb surface. The duration of the waggle portion indicates the distance to the food, while the angle relative to gravity conveys the direction relative to the sun. This intricate system allows the hive to efficiently allocate foraging resources, ensuring that multiple bees do not waste energy searching the same area while neglecting distant, abundant flowers.

    "question": "Read the historical account and the fictional excerpt below.\n\n**Historical Account:**\nOn December 25–26, 1776, General George Washington led approximately 2,400 Continental soldiers across the icy Delaware River. Historical records indicate that the troops faced snow and floating ice during the nighttime crossing in difficult winter conditions. The army reached Trenton, New Jersey, by morning and successfully surprised the Hessian garrison, capturing most of the enemy forces.\n\n**Fictional Excerpt:**\nIn the winter of 1776, James huddled against the frozen gunwale, his breath forming ragged clouds in the air. Through the blinding sleet, he saw General Washington standing tall at the bow, seemingly untouched by the howling gale. \"Remember your homes!\" the General called above the storm. James gripped his musket tighter, thinking of his brother who had died at the hands of the Hessians. The ice groaned beneath the boats as they drifted toward the enemy shore, where the unsuspecting Hessians slept in warm barracks.\n\nWhich choice best describes how the author of the fictional account alters history compared to the historical account?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The fictional account changes the date of the crossing from December 25–26 to December 24, 1776.",
      "B": "The fictional account invents a specific soldier's personal thoughts and adds sensory details to create emotional impact while maintaining the historical outcome.",

      "D": "The fictional account alters history by stating that the Hessian forces defeated the Continental Army at Trenton."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because the fictional account creates a character named James with specific emotional motivations (revenge for his brother) and adds vivid sensory elements (frozen gunwale, blinding sleet, howling gale, groaning ice) that are not present in the historical record. This demonstrates how authors of fiction alter historical facts by inventing personal perspectives and heightening dramatic details to engage readers emotionally, even while keeping the actual outcome (the surprise attack on the Hessians) consistent with history.",

    "question": "Read this excerpt from an editorial about school start times.\n\nMany experts agree that teenagers need more sleep. Dr. Smith, a sleep researcher, states that adolescents require nine hours of sleep for optimal health. However, some critics argue that changing school start times would disrupt after-school activities. This concern is unfounded because schools that have shifted to later start times report that students simply schedule activities later in the day.\n\nThe author claims that concerns about after-school activities are unfounded. Which choice best explains how the evidence supports this claim?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "It offers a personal opinion from a parent about schedule changes.",
      "B": "It demonstrates that students at these schools adapted their schedules without missing activities.",
      "C": "It presents data showing that teenagers need nine hours of sleep.",
      "D": "It suggests that after-school activities are unnecessary for student development."

    "question": "Read this excerpt from a literary nonfiction article about career habits.\n\n'Many CEOs of Fortune 500 companies report waking up before 6:00 AM daily. This proves that rising early is essential for professional achievement. I personally began waking at 5:30 AM last year, and since then I have been promoted twice. Therefore, anyone seeking career advancement should adopt an early wake-up routine.'\n\nWhich choice best evaluates the argument's use of reasoning and evidence?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The argument fails to define what constitutes a 'successful CEO.'",

      "D": "The argument includes specific times that are too early for most students."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because it accurately identifies that the argument uses a personal anecdote (the author's two promotions), which is insufficient evidence for a universal claim about career success, and it confuses correlation with causation (the fact that CEOs wake early does not prove that waking early causes success). This directly addresses the standard's requirement to assess whether the reasoning is sound and the evidence is relevant and sufficient to support the claims.",

To support this claim, she cites a 2019 survey in which 85% of respondents stated they “felt more appreciated” receiving handwritten letters compared to emails. Which choice best evaluates whether the evidence Vargas provides is sufficient to support her claim?",
    "answer": "C",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The evidence is sufficient because the survey was conducted recently in 2019.",
      "B": "The evidence is sufficient because 85% represents a clear majority of respondents.",

      "D": "The evidence is irrelevant because digital messages were not invented in 2019."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option C is correct because it accurately assesses that, although the survey data about appreciation is related to the topic of correspondence, it fails to sufficiently prove the specific claim that handwritten letters foster deeper emotional connections. The evidence addresses a tangential feeling (appreciation upon receipt) rather than the depth or quality of the emotional bond formed, revealing a gap between the claim and the proof offered.",
