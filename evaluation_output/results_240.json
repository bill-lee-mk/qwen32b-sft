No stimuli.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (commit list):\n- ISSUE1 (Primary: distractor_quality): Snippet: \"...examined the fingerprints and ______ that the suspect had been in the room...\" with option D = \"wondered\". Insertion yields \"wondered that\", which is unidiomatic; the natural construction is \"wondered whether/if\". This creates a grammatically implausible distractor, allowing students to eliminate D based on grammar rather than the targeted semantic nuance, weakening distractor quality.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Keyed answer B matches options; explanation aligns with stem and options. No mismatches.\nChecklist B1 (Answer Giveaway, practice/assessment): No visible answer in student-facing text; no reveal cues needed; passes.\nChecklist B2 (Stimulus Quality): No stimulus; N/A.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No typos or merged words in student-facing content.\n\nStep 3 – Metric scores based only on committed issues:\n- factual_accuracy: 1.0 (no factual/semantic errors; degrees-of-certainty rationale is correct).\n- educational_accuracy: 1.0 (assesses shades of meaning; no giveaway; appropriate for intent).\n- curriculum_alignment: 1.0 (direct match to CCSS L.3.5.C: distinguish shades of meaning among verbs of certainty: know, believe, suspect, wonder).\n- clarity_precision: 1.0 (task clear; what to do is unambiguous).\n- specification_compliance: 1.0 (no explicit hard spec provided; treat as pass).\n- reveals_misconceptions: 1.0 (distractors map to common degrees-of-certainty misunderstandings).\n- difficulty_alignment: 1.0 (No Difficulty Definitions provided → Scenario 2. For Grade 3 L.3.5.C, “hard” can involve fine-grained semantic distinctions in context. This item requires interpreting contextual cues (“strong evidence but not absolute certainty”) to choose between believed vs suspected vs knew; this is plausibly Medium–Hard for Grade 3; acceptable alignment.)\n- passage_reference: 1.0 (no passage required; self-contained).\n- distractor_quality: 0.0 (ISSUE1: grammatically implausible distractor D due to “wondered that”).\n- stimulus_quality: 1.0 (no stimulus).\n- mastery_learning_alignment: 1.0 (requires semantic reasoning, not pure recall).\n- localization_quality: 1.0 (neutral, age-appropriate context).\n\nStep 4 – Overall score selection: C=0 (no critical fails), N=1 (one non-critical fail).
