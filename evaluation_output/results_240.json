No merged non-words in the stem. \n- Potential concern considered: The stem references “adding suffixes to the base words ‘stop’, ‘hope’, and ‘try’,” while the correct sentence uses “try” in base form (“to try”). This could be read as expecting a suffix on all three words. However, the skill focus is correct application of spelling patterns when suffixes are used; in the given grammatical context, no suffix is required for “try,” and none of the options present the correct suffixed form “trying.” This does not create actionable ambiguity that would change a reasonable student’s interpretation, so no clarity failure is recorded.\n\nConclusion: No concrete issues identified. All checklists passed.\n\nStep 3 – Metric scoring: With no issues, all binary metrics = 1.0.\n\nStep 4 – Overall per rules: C=0, N=0 ⇒ choose 0.85–1.0. Item is strong and well-aligned; score set to 0.95 (Acceptable, high).\n\nStep 5 – Self-consistency: No failed metrics; no unresolved issues.",
