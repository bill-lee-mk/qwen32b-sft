When a base word ends in 'x,' we simply add '-s' to form the third-person singular present tense verb, making 'mix' correct.\" Problems: (a) Third-person singular of verbs ending in x takes -es (\"mixes\"), not just -s; (b) The sentence requires the base form after \"to\" (\"to mix\"), not third-person singular. Thus the rationale contains factual errors and conflicts with the sentence context.\n\nChecklist A (Field consistency): Labeled correct option (C) matches the sentence context, but the explanation is factually incorrect regarding suffix rules and verb form. → factual_accuracy issue logged.\nChecklist B1 (Answer giveaway): No explicit answer given pre-attempt; no reveal text. → No issue.\nChecklist B2 (Stimulus): No stimulus. → No issue.\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): Student-facing text is clear; misspellings are intentional distractors. → No issue.\n\nStep 3: Metric scoring driven by the single factual-accuracy issue.

Metadata labels standard RF.3.3.D and correct answer C with an explanation.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (commit list):\n- ISSUE1 (factual_accuracy): Explanation text: \"Option C is correct because 'story' is an irregularly spelled word... The 'o' makes an /aw/ sound... and the ending 'y' makes an /ee/ sound, which doesn't follow typical spelling patterns.\" Problems: (a) \"story\" is not an irregularly spelled word; it follows common r-controlled vowel pattern 'or' and the typical rule that final y in two-syllable words says /i/ (long e). (b) Claiming the final y sound \"doesn't follow typical spelling patterns\" is incorrect for grade-level phonics instruction. (c) Framing the 'o' as /aw/ vs short /o/ is misleading; in \"story\" the vowel is the r-controlled 'or' (e.g., /ɔr/), which is a standard pattern, not an irregular deviation. Thus the rationale contains factual inaccuracies.\n- ISSUE2 (curriculum_alignment): Metadata specifies CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RF.3.3.D (read grade-appropriate irregularly spelled words). The item asks students to select the correct spelling of a regular, decodable word (story) from plausible misspellings, assessing conventional spelling knowledge and patterns (final y, r-controlled vowels, consonant doubling) rather than reading irregularly spelled words. This aligns better with L.3.2 (spelling conventions) than RF.3.3.D. Therefore, clear misalignment with the explicitly named standard.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): The keyed answer (C) matches the options and the sentence. Mismatch exists in explanation claims (addressed as ISSUE1 under factual_accuracy). Checklist B1 (Answer giveaway): No pre-attempt giveaway. Checklist B2 (Stimulus): No stimulus. Checklist C (Typos/clarity): Stem is clear; misspellings are intentional distractors; no stray symbols or merged words in instructions.\n\nStep 3 – Metric scores derived from the above issues.\nStep 4 – Overall per rules: C=1 (factual), N=1 (curriculum).

Explanation references misspellings that correspond to options (ruff→rough, thot→thought, herd→heard, tuff→tough, mountin→mountain). No mismatches.\n- Checklist B1 (Giveaway): No answer revealed in student-facing pre-attempt text; no reveal cues needed.

Checklists A, B, C passed.\n\nMetric analyses:\n- Factual accuracy: Correct option is truly correct; other choices contain plausible misspellings. Minor nuance: explanation labels all words in C as “irregular” (young, calf clearly; born/hours arguably decodable), but this does not impact correctness and is acceptable within pedagogical framing; not a concrete factual error.\n- Educational accuracy: Assesses recognition of correctly spelled irregular/tricky words; no giveaways; appropriate for standard.\n- Curriculum alignment: Matches RF.3.3.D—recognizing/readability of irregular words via correct spelling identification.\n- Clarity: Stem unambiguous about selecting the sentence where all irregularly spelled words are correct.\n- Specification compliance: No explicit item-writing spec provided; nothing to enforce.\n- Reveals misconceptions: Distractors mirror common phonetic approximations of irregular patterns (ough/ough variants, ea/oa/ear/hear, mountain syllabication), thus diagnostically useful.\n- Difficulty alignment: No formal difficulty definitions provided. Scenario 2 applies. For G3 RF.3.3.D, “hard” might involve multiple irregulars and homophone traps in context. This item requires scanning multiple words and distinguishing irregular patterns; overall seems Medium-to-Hard for G3 but not ≥2-grade misaligned → pass.\n- Passage reference: N/A.\n- Distractor quality: Parallel sentence structures; plausible misspellings; balanced length; no telegraphing.\n- Stimulus quality: N/A (no stimulus).\n- Mastery learning: Requires application/analysis (detecting correct vs phonetic misspellings), not pure recall.\n- Localization: Neutral, culturally appropriate.\n\nOverall scoring rule: C=0 (no critical failures), N=0 → overall must be in [0.85, 1.0].

This length/detail imbalance may telegraph the correct answer.\n- ISSUE2 (difficulty_alignment): Labeled difficulty = “hard,” but task is a straightforward identification of the strongest reason; only one option presents a clear evidence-based health rationale while others are aesthetic/preference/convenience. Cognitive demand is closer to Easy–Medium for Grade 3, not Hard.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): Answer key = C and explanation match options and content.
