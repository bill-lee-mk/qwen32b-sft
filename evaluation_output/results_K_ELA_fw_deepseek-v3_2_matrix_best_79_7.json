Applied a Kindergarten ELA difficulty bar: \n- Easy: Recognize/apply a single capitalization rule in a simple sentence.\n- Medium: Coordinate multiple rules or less familiar contexts.\n- Hard: Multi-rule evaluation across more complex sentences/passages or edge cases.\nThis item asks students to recognize two basic rules (first word and I) in a simple, familiar sentence with clear visual cues (capital letters). That aligns with Easy for K, not Hard. Hence labeled difficulty mismatch → fail.",

Appropriate for K with guidance.\n- Curriculum alignment: Matches CCSS W.K.8 (recall/gather info from provided source to answer a question).\n- Clarity: Task is clear; pronoun “It” logically refers to the cat (dog mentioned later).

Two unmentioned animals test attention to source.\n- Stimulus quality: None; not applicable.\n- Mastery learning: Requires using textual evidence rather than recall of world knowledge.\n- Localization: Neutral, age-appropriate.\n\nC=0, N=0 → Overall in 0.85–1.0; choose 0.95 (solid quality, not extraordinary).",
