    "question": "Scientists have long studied the remarkable ways honeybees communicate with one another to maintain efficient colony operations. When a forager bee discovers a rich source of nectar, it returns to the hive and performs a specific dance on the honeycomb. Known as the waggle dance, this movement pattern conveys precise information about the location of the food source. The direction of the dance indicates the direction of the food relative to the sun, while the duration of the waggle portion signals the distance to the flowers. Researchers at a university recently observed that bees adjust their dances based on environmental conditions and resource quality. If the nectar source is particularly abundant, the forager performs the dance more vigorously and repeats it more frequently than for a smaller find. This behavioral adaptation ensures that more bees are recruited to visit the high-quality food source quickly. Even more remarkably, experienced bees sometimes stop dancing entirely if they detect through chemical signals that too many foragers are already heading to that location, preventing overcrowding and wasted energy at the food site.\n\nWhich inference about honeybee behavior is best supported by details in the passage?",
    "answer": "C",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Honeybees perform dances only when they are hungry.",
      "B": "Honeybees communicate primarily through chemical signals rather than movement.",
      "C": "Honeybees adjust their communication based on the quality and availability of food.",
      "D": "Honeybees always travel to food sources that are closest to the hive."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option C is correct because the passage states that bees adjust their dances based on 'resource quality,' performing them more vigorously for abundant nectar and stopping when too many foragers are already heading to a location, which demonstrates that their communication methods change according to food quality and availability.",

When the plant closed in 2019, displacing eight hundred workers, the mayor promised 'a vibrant new chapter' for the district, pledging tax incentives for new businesses. Today, the street’s carefully preserved brick facades remain intact, painted in historically accurate cream and hunter green, yet half the storefronts display 'For Lease' signs in dust-coated windows. The coffee shop still opens at six, but the owner, Maria Chen, admits she stays busy only because she drives forty minutes to the county farmers' market three mornings a week to buy specialty produce for a handful of loyal customers. Last month, the city installed vintage-style streetlamps and planted maple saplings along the sidewalk, investments totaling nearly $50,000. However, the evening foot traffic that once filled the sidewalks during the summer festival has dwindled to a few dog walkers and teenagers on scooters. The chamber of commerce brochure still advertises 'the historic heart of industry,' though the only machinery noise now comes from the demolition crew clearing the old rail yard on the outskirts. A new logistics hub promised in 2020 has yet to break ground.\n\nWhich choice best describes an inference supported by the passage?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The town has successfully transitioned to an agriculture-based economy, as shown by Maria Chen’s trips to the farmers' market.",
      "B": "The town's revitalization efforts focus on appearance rather than substantive economic recovery, as shown by the installation of vintage streetlamps and preserved facades while storefronts remain vacant and the chamber of commerce clings to outdated industrial imagery.",
      "C": "The town is actively dismantling its industrial past to make way for modern logistics development, as evidenced by the demolition crew clearing the old rail yard and the promised new logistics hub.",
      "D": "The summer festival has been permanently discontinued due to lack of community interest, accounting for the absence of evening foot traffic on Mill Street."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because the passage provides specific textual evidence that the town’s efforts are cosmetic: it notes the installation of 'vintage-style streetlamps' and 'maple saplings' alongside 'carefully preserved brick facades,' while simultaneously highlighting the economic reality of 'For Lease' signs in half the storefronts and the chamber of commerce’s reliance on outdated industrial imagery ('historic heart of industry') despite the absence of actual industry. This contrast supports the inference that revitalization prioritizes visual appearance over genuine economic recovery.",

    "question": "Marie Curie was a pioneering physicist and chemist who conducted groundbreaking research on radioactivity. Born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1867, she faced significant obstacles as a woman pursuing higher education in a time when academic opportunities for women were severely limited. Despite these challenges, she moved to Paris to study at the Sorbonne, where she earned degrees in physics and mathematics through relentless dedication. In 1903, she became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing the award with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel. Eight years later, she won a second Nobel Prize in Chemistry, making her the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. During World War I, Curie developed mobile radiography units, known as \"Little Curies,\" to provide X-ray services to field hospitals near the front lines. She believed that science should serve humanity and spent her final years directing the Radium Institute in Paris, mentoring future scientists until her death in 1934.

    "question": "The Dust Bowl of the 1930s stands as one of the most devastating environmental disasters in American history. During this period, massive dust storms darkened skies across the Great Plains, destroying crops and forcing thousands of families to abandon their farms. While many attributed the disaster solely to a prolonged drought, the reality was far more complex. In the decades prior, farmers had adopted new mechanized farming techniques that allowed them to break up millions of acres of native prairie grassland. These deep-rooted grasses had evolved over thousands of years to anchor the soil and withstand drought conditions. When removed to plant wheat, the exposed topsoil lay loose and vulnerable. When severe drought struck in the early 1930s, the parched, unanchored soil offered no resistance to the region's high winds. Massive clouds of dust, some reaching heights of 10,000 feet, swept across the plains, burying homes and machinery. The disaster ultimately forced a national reckoning with agricultural practices, leading to soil conservation districts and new farming methods. Today, the Dust Bowl serves as a stark reminder of how human alteration of natural landscapes can amplify natural weather events into catastrophic outcomes.\n\nWhich choice best identifies the central idea of the passage and explains how it is conveyed through particular details?",

While developers view empty lots as opportunities for profit, conservationists see them as potential sanctuaries for endangered native species. The choice is stark: we can either prioritize short-term economic gains or preserve the intricate web of life that sustains our ecosystem for future generations.\"\n\nWhich choice best describes the author's point of view and how it is conveyed in the text?",
    "answer": "B",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "The author believes urban development is always harmful and conveys this by attacking developers personally.",

      "D": "The author suggests that endangered species should be moved to rural areas and conveys this by describing concrete jungles as unsuitable for wildlife."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because the author clearly advocates for the ecological importance of city parks by juxtaposing developers' profit motives with conservationists' environmental goals. The phrase 'critical lifelines' establishes the point of view that parks are essential for biodiversity, while the contrasting structure 'While developers view... conservationists see...' deliberately highlights the conflict between economic and environmental values to persuade readers toward preservation.",

City officials projected this policy would significantly reduce the city's overall water consumption.\n\nGraph Description: A bar graph displays municipal water consumption from 2020-2024. It shows that after remaining stable at 100 million gallons through 2021, total consumption fell to 80 million gallons by 2023. The graph breaks down usage by sector, revealing that residential consumption decreased by 30% while commercial consumption increased by 10% during this period.\n\nWhich choice best integrates the information from the text and the graph to develop a coherent understanding of the ordinance's impact?",

His grandfather had left it there decades ago after the war, claiming music had no place in a practical world. Dust coated the strings like snow. Yet when Marcus touched the bow to them, a thin, wavering note emerged—frail but defiant. He played until his fingers ached, filling the silence that had suffocated the house for years.

The thud of boots above reminded her that survival meant staying silent and preserving the stories of her heritage.\n\nExcerpt B (from a fantasy story): As the dragon army descended upon the castle, Kira raised her enchanted sword. The air crackled with magic as she vowed to defeat the beasts and reclaim the kingdom for her people.\n\nWhich choice best describes a difference in how these two texts approach the theme of facing danger?",
