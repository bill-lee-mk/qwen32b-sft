Ms. Gomez says that so far this month, we have saved 20 pounds of ground beef. That means 20 fewer cows needing food and water, and 20 fewer plastic trays in the trash. Last week, 75 students tried the chili and said they would choose it again. The cafeteria is planning to add another Meatless Meal on Friday.”\n\nThen you see this bar graph on the screen:\n\nBeef Saved (pounds) | January – not Meatless | 0\n                  | February – 3-day Meatless | 20\n                  | March – planned 5-day Meatless | 40\n\nWhich choice BEST states the MAIN IDEA and gives TWO supporting details—one from the announcement and one from the graph?",
