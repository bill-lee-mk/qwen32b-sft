Alternate interpretations could lead students to choose Dylan (assuming 150–155 WPM is still appropriate if expressive) or even Alex (assuming 92% may still count as ‘with accuracy’ and 105–108 WPM may be considered appropriate). Because the stem doesn’t provide the criteria later used in the explanation (110–140 WPM and ≥95% accuracy), a student could reasonably arrive at different answers based on differing notions of ‘appropriate’ and ‘accuracy’. Primary metric: clarity_precision.\n\nChecklist A (Field Consistency): The answer key (C) and explanation are internally coherent; the explanation’s thresholds (≥95% accuracy, 110–140 WPM) match selection of Casey. No mismatches found.\n\nChecklist B (Answer Giveaway): No pre-attempt giveaways. No hints/solutions shown before answering.\n\nChecklist C (Diction/Typo): No typos, merged words, or stray confusing symbols found.\n\nStep 3 – Metrics: Only clarity_precision failed due to undefined criteria. All other metrics pass.\n\nStep 4 – Overall Scoring: C=0 (no critical failures), N=1 (clarity_precision). Per rules, overall must be 0.75–0.84. The issue is minor and easily fixable (add explicit criteria), so choose upper half: 0.84.\n\nStep 5 – Consistency: Single identified issue maps to clarity_precision=0.0; all other metrics 1.0.",
