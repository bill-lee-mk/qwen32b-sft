Treat as practice/assessment.\n\nStep 2 – Issues (committed list):\n- ISSUE1 (educational_accuracy): Student-facing option A literally says “The correct choice that matches the standard.” This trivially reveals the answer. This is a pre-attempt giveaway for a practice item.\n  Snippet: Option A text: “The correct choice that matches the standard.”\n- ISSUE2 (clarity_precision): The stem is not understandable for K students and is ambiguous: “Which choice best demonstrates the skill described in L.K.1.B at medium difficulty?” Students cannot know what “L.K.1.B” or “medium difficulty” means, nor what action (about nouns/verbs) is required. Alternate interpretations: (a) choose any option referencing the standard; (b) guess; (c) meta-knowledge about standards rather than language use.\n  Snippet: Stem text quoted above.\n- ISSUE3 (curriculum_alignment): L.K.1.B is “Use frequently occurring nouns and verbs.” The item does not ask students to identify or use nouns/verbs; it asks about a standard code. Misaligned with target skill.\n  Snippet: Stem references the code; options are generic placeholders, not nouns/verbs tasks.\n- ISSUE4 (distractor_quality): Distractors are placeholders (“An incorrect distractor.”) and do not plausibly compete with the correct answer; the correct option is telegraphed by stating it is correct. Poor parallelism in specificity/diagnostic value.\n  Snippets: Options B–D texts.\n- ISSUE5 (reveals_misconceptions): Choices do not embody real misconceptions about nouns vs verbs; they are generic labels, so the item cannot diagnose misunderstandings of the standard.\n- ISSUE6 (difficulty_alignment): For K, interpreting a standards code and meta-language (“medium difficulty”) is well beyond grade level. No difficulty definitions provided; applying Scenario 2, this is at least 2+ grade levels above in reading/meta-concept demand for K.\n- ISSUE7 (mastery_learning_alignment): The task requires no application of the target skill (identifying/using nouns or verbs). With the giveaway, no reasoning is needed; even without, it measures meta-knowledge, not mastery of nouns/verbs.\n\nChecklist A – Field Consistency: Labeled correct answer A matches explanation referencing A; no mismatches with options. Pass (no factual issue).\nChecklist B – Answer Giveaway (practice/assessment): Yes – Option A declares itself correct in student-facing text. Fail under educational_accuracy (ISSUE1).\nChecklist C – Diction/Typo: No typos/merged non-words beyond the meta phrasing; clarity issue already captured (ISSUE2).\n\nStep 3 – Metric scores set accordingly.\nStep 4 – Overall score per rules: C=1 (educational_accuracy), N=6 (clarity_precision, curriculum_alignment, distractor_quality, reveals_misconceptions, difficulty_alignment, mastery_learning_alignment). Range 0.55–0.75. Choose lower half due to critical failure and multiple non-critical failures → 0.60.\nStep 5 – Self-consistency: Each 0.0 metric has a cited issue; factual_accuracy/localization/stimulus/passage/spec pass with no issues.",

Example: Show pictures (cat, run, ball) and ask “Which one is a verb?” Or show a short sentence: “The dog runs.” Ask: “Which word is a verb?”\n- Replace placeholder options with real, parallel choices and avoid giveaways. Ensure all options are words (e.g., cat, run, red) and only one fits the asked category.\n- Make distractors reflect common misconceptions (e.g., include an adjective like “red” alongside a noun and a verb).\n- Keep vocabulary simple and familiar; consider audio support for K.\n- Provide clear directions: “Choose the verb.” or “Choose the word that names a person, place, or thing (a noun).”"
