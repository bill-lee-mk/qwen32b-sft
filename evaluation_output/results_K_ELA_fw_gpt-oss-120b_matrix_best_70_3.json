Explanation: “Option A is correct… The other options change one of the sounds.”\n\nStep 2 – Issues:\nISSUE1 (Factual Accuracy): Explanation claims “The other options change one of the sounds.” However, option C “k – a – t” represents the same phoneme sequence /k/ /æ/ /t/ as “c – a – t”; ‘k’ and ‘c’ both represent the /k/ sound in English. Given the stem’s focus on sounds, C does not change the sound. This creates a mislabeled-only-correct answer and a false claim in the rationale.\nISSUE2 (Clarity & Precision): Stem asks about “sounds” while choices are letters. With that wording, both A and C are plausibly correct (same sounds), but only A matches the actual spelling of “cat.” Two interpretations: (a) isolate phonemes (A or C acceptable) vs (b) segment letters of the printed word (only A). This ambiguity can change how a student answers.\nISSUE3 (Distractor Quality): Option C is functionally correct under the stem’s “sounds” framing, so options are not mutually exclusive and the distractor is not diagnostic.\nISSUE4 (Difficulty Alignment): Item labeled “hard,” but isolating the three sounds in a simple, highly common CVC (“cat”) is baseline K-level work.
