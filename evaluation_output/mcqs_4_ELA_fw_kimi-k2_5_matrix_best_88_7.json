Similarly, 'were setting' is the past progressive tense with the plural helper verb 'were' (agreeing with the plural subject 'assistants') and the present participle 'setting' formed by doubling the final consonant 't' before adding -ing.

    "question": "Read the passage and answer the question that follows.\n\nArctic foxes undergo a remarkable transformation each autumn. As daylight hours shrink, hormonal changes trigger a three-week molt from summer brown to winter white. During this transition, foxes drastically reduce their roaming range and hunt exclusively during twilight hours when lengthening shadows offer natural concealment. Wildlife biologists tracking two populations—one in stable tundra conditions and another in coastal areas with erratic freeze-thaw cycles—observed a striking difference. While both groups initiated molting simultaneously, the coastal foxes suspended their color change mid-process whenever temperatures rose above freezing, resuming only after five consecutive days of sub-zero conditions. This interrupted molting extended their vulnerability period by up to ten days, yet these populations showed higher survival rates than inland foxes forced to complete rapid transformations regardless of ground cover.\n\nWhich inference about the coastal Arctic foxes is best supported by the details in the passage?",

If the food is far away, the bee executes a “waggle dance,” a figure‑eight pattern that indicates both the direction and distance of the food source. For nearby flowers, the bee performs a simpler “round dance.” Through these precise movements, scout bees share vital information, allowing the colony to efficiently gather food from wide areas.\n\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the passage?",

I grabbed the railing as heat washed over my face. 'Get out!' someone screamed. I jumped through a window and ran as fast as I could, my heart pounding. The ground felt hard under my feet, and I didn't stop until I reached the field's edge.\n\nAccount 2: The Hindenburg disaster occurred on May 6, 1937, at Naval Air Station Lakehurst in New Jersey.

    "question": "Text 1: Every fall, millions of monarch butterflies leave their summer homes in Canada and the United States to travel south. These delicate insects fly up to 3,000 miles to reach their winter homes in Mexico. To make this long journey, monarchs must store up fat by eating flower nectar during the summer. Without enough energy saved, they cannot complete the migration.\n\nText 2: Scientists are worried about monarch butterfly populations. In Mexico, illegal logging is destroying the forests where monarchs spend the winter. In the United States and Canada, farmers use chemicals that kill milkweed plants. Monarch caterpillars can only eat milkweed, so fewer plants means fewer butterflies can grow and survive to make the fall migration.\n\nWhich choice best integrates information from both texts to explain why monarch butterflies are facing survival challenges?",
    "answer": "C",
    "answer_options": {
      "A": "Monarch butterflies store up fat by eating flower nectar during the summer so they can fly up to 3,000 miles to Mexico.",
      "B": "Illegal logging in Mexico destroys winter forests, and chemicals in the United States kill milkweed that caterpillars need to survive.",
      "C": "Because monarchs need stored energy for a 3,000-mile journey, the loss of milkweed in the north and winter forests in the south makes it harder for them to survive the migration.",
      "D": "Monarch butterflies are the only insects that can fly 3,000 miles, and they eat milkweed in Mexico during the winter to store energy."
    },
    "answer_explanation": "Option C is correct because it integrates information from both texts by connecting the energy requirements and long migration distance from the first text with the habitat destruction in both the northern breeding grounds and southern wintering grounds described in the second text, showing how these combined factors threaten the butterflies' survival.",

      "A": "School should start later in the morning. First, students need more sleep to stay healthy. Second, later start times improve focus in class. Finally, families would have easier morning routines. For these reasons, I believe school start times should change.",
      "B": "Many schools begin at 8:00 AM. Students often feel tired in the morning. Teachers notice that tired students have trouble learning. There are different opinions about schedules.",
      "C": "I think school should start later. It would help everyone. Kids like sleeping. Breakfast is important. Some buses are late anyway. We should change the time.",
      "D": "I believe this is a bad idea. It affects health and learning. Students need rest. Parents might disagree. We should consider all sides."
