      "question": "Read the passage below.\n\nWhen the Brooklyn Bridge opened in 1883, it was hailed as a marvel of engineering, connecting the bustling cities of New York and Brooklyn for the first time. The bridge’s construction, however, was a long and perilous struggle. Its original designer, John Roebling, passed away after an accident at the very start of the project. The massive responsibility fell to his son, Washington Roebling. Washington introduced a revolutionary technique using pneumatic caissons—huge, airtight wooden boxes sunk into the riverbed—to build the bridge’s massive stone towers. Inside these caissons, workers dug away the river bottom in harsh, pressurized conditions. Many suffered from \"the bends,\" a painful sickness caused by rapid changes in air pressure. Washington himself became bedridden from the disease. **Although** his body was failing him, his mind remained sharp, and he directed the entire project from his bedroom window. With the help of his wife, Emily, who learned advanced mathematics to communicate his orders, the great bridge eventually rose above the East River.\n\nIn the sentence describing Washington’s condition, the conjunction \"Although\" functions to signal a __________ between his physical weakness and his mental strength.",
      "answer": "contrast",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is \"contrast\". In the sentence \"Although his body was failing him, his mind remained sharp,\" the conjunction \"Although\" is used to connect two ideas that are opposite or unexpected in relation to each other. The first idea (his failing body) leads the reader to expect failure or inability, but the second idea (his sharp mind/supervision) opposes that expectation. Therefore, the function of the conjunction in this specific context is to establish a contrast (or difference/opposition) between his physical state and his mental capabilities.",

      "question": "Read the passage below.\n\nThe Great Lighthouse of Alexandria, known as the Pharos, was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Built around 280 BCE, this massive structure stood on the island of Pharos in Egypt, guarding the entrance to the port. It was a masterpiece of engineering designed to guide trade ships safely **into** the busy harbor. For centuries, a massive fire burned at the very top, and polished bronze mirrors reflected the light deep **across** the Mediterranean Sea. The tower served as a vital landmark **for** sailors navigating the treacherous coast.\n\nDespite its solid construction, the lighthouse faced many challenges **throughout** its long history. It withstood powerful waves crashing **against** its base and survived several minor tremors that shook the region. Tragically, a series of major earthquakes **during** the medieval period eventually damaged the structure beyond repair. **Since** its final destruction in the 14th century, the ruins have lain scattered underwater. **Since** the site is historically significant today, marine archaeologists explore the area carefully. They have discovered massive stone blocks and statues resting **beneath** the waves, confirming the grandeur of the lost monument.\n\nThe word \"Since\" appears twice in the second paragraph. In the clause \"Since the site is historically significant,\" it functions as a conjunction meaning \"because.\" However, in the phrase \"Since its final destruction,\" it functions as a preposition.

However, in the phrase \"Since its final destruction,\" the word is followed by a noun phrase and indicates the starting point of the period during which the ruins have lain underwater.

Together, they fly **toward** the warmer climates of the south, covering hundreds of miles each day. The lead goose faces the strongest wind resistance and works the hardest.

The ground rushed up to meet them, a blur of red rocks and jagged craters.\n\nJust as the proximity alarm began to screech, the automated landing legs deployed.

It requires precise timing and coordination between Earth and the Red Planet. Cargo ships can only depart Earth when the two planets align properly, a launch window that opens approximately every twenty-six months. Once launched, the journey across the vast emptiness of space takes about nine months. Currently, the supply ship *Ares IV* is halfway through its voyage to Mars. It carries vital solar panels and life-support equipment needed for the future colony.\n\nMeanwhile, on the dusty Martian surface, a team of autonomous rovers is tirelessly preparing the landing site. These advanced machines are programmed to clear sharp rocks, level the uneven red soil, and compact the ground to support heavy machinery. The mission control team in Houston monitors the progress closely. The rovers have a strict deadline: they must finish constructing the landing pad before the *Ares IV* enters orbit. If the pad is not ready, the ship cannot land safely. Fortunately, the data shows the rovers are working ahead of schedule. The flight director is confident that by the time the ship enters orbit next month, the rovers __________ the landing pad.\n\nFill in the blank with the correct form of the verb **complete**. You must use a **perfect verb tense** to indicate that the action will be finished before the ship arrives.",

      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is \"will have completed\". To determine the correct verb form, the student must analyze the timeline in the passage. The sentence refers to a future event (\"next month\") when the ship enters orbit. The action of the rovers (completing the landing pad) must happen *before* that specific future moment. In grammar, the tense used to describe an action that will be finished before a specific time in the future is the **future perfect tense**. The future perfect tense is formed using \"will have\" followed by the past participle of the verb. Therefore, the correct form of \"complete\" is \"will have completed\".",

      "question": "In the mid-19th century, California became the center of world attention due to a shiny, yellow metal. The famous Gold Rush began in 1848, but the massive wave of people, known as \"forty-niners,\" did not flood the region until 1849. These fortune seekers traveled by sea and land, dreaming of instant wealth. However, the Sacramento Valley was not empty before their chaotic arrival. John Sutter, a Swiss immigrant with ambitious dreams, had arrived in California in 1839, a full decade earlier. He successfully negotiated with the Mexican government to secure a massive land grant and spent the next ten years developing a settlement called New Helvetia. He constructed a large fort, developed a mill, and planted vast fields of wheat. He envisioned an agricultural paradise, not a mining camp. When the gold seekers finally overran his land in 1849, they trampled his crops and stole his livestock. It was a cruel twist of fate that the discovery of gold, which made many strangers rich, ultimately ruined the man who owned the land where it was first found.\n\nBased on the timeline in the passage, complete the sentence below using the correct form of the verb **establish**.\n\nBy the time the gold seekers arrived in 1849, John Sutter __________ a thriving settlement in the valley.",

      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is 'had established'. The passage describes a specific sequence of events in the past: Sutter arriving and developing his settlement (starting in 1839) happened before the gold seekers arrived (in 1849). The sentence uses the phrase 'By the time', which signals that the first action was completed prior to the second past action. Therefore, the past perfect tense (formed by 'had' + the past participle 'established') is required to convey this sequence. Using the simple past tense 'established' would be incorrect because it does not grammatically emphasize that the action was completed before the miners' arrival.",

      "question": "Read the passage below about the Karluk expedition.\n\nIn August 1913, the Canadian Arctic Expedition’s flagship, the Karluk, became trapped in heavy pack ice north of Alaska. Captain Robert Bartlett, a navigator famous for his Arctic expertise, realized the situation was perilous as temperatures plummeted. As the brutal winter set in, the ice tightened its grip around the wooden hull, groaning under the immense pressure. The crew worked tirelessly to unload supplies onto the ice floe, establishing a camp and preparing for the worst. For five long months, the ship drifted west with the frozen mass, carrying the men far from their intended destination. On January 11, 1914, the force of the ice finally became too great to withstand. The ice buckled the ship’s sturdy frame, and water poured uncontrollably into the lower decks. While the helpless crew watched from their camp, the broken vessel sinks slowly into the freezing depths of the Arctic Ocean. Bartlett later led the survivors on a dangerous march to Wrangel Island, and he eventually traveled across the frozen Chukchi Sea to Siberia to organize a rescue mission.\n\nIn the sentence beginning \"While the helpless crew...\", one verb incorrectly shifts into the present tense. The correct simple past tense form of that verb is __________.",
      "answer": "sank",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is \"sank\". To determine the answer, the student must first analyze the passage to identify the consistent verb tense used throughout. The author uses the past tense to describe the historical events (e.g., \"became\", \"realized\", \"tightened\", \"drifted\", \"led\"). Next, the student must locate the error in the specified sentence: \"While the helpless crew watched from their camp, the broken vessel sinks slowly...\" In this sentence, \"watched\" is in the past tense, but \"sinks\" shifts inappropriately to the present tense. Finally, the student must apply their knowledge of irregular verbs to convert \"sinks\" into the correct simple past tense form, which is \"sank\".",

Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, embarked on a grueling quest to identify the source of radiation in pitchblende. They conducted their experiments in an abandoned shed that was freezing in winter and stifling in summer. Despite the poor conditions, Marie processed tons of industrial waste to extract tiny amounts of active material. The work demanded immense physical effort and precise chemical knowledge. By July 1898, the couple successfully identified a new element, which they named polonium in honor of Marie’s homeland. The research continued without pause. In December of that same year, the Curies announce the discovery of an even more powerful element, radium. This achievement astonished scientists around the world and paved the way for new medical treatments. Years later, Marie became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, cementing her place in history as a pioneer of modern science.\n\nThe passage contains an inappropriate shift in verb tense in the sentence describing the discovery of radium.

His detailed itinerary focused on two historic major cities: Paris and Rome. He had bought tickets to climb the Eiffel Tower in Paris and booked a guided tour of the Colosseum in Rome. On the morning of his departure, however, terrible news arrived. A massive Atlantic storm system had unexpectedly shifted, grounding all flights into Paris indefinitely. James frantically checked for travel alternatives, hoping to salvage the trip, but bad luck struck a second time. A sudden, unannounced workers' strike had halted all trains traveling to Rome. James sat on his suitcase in the busy terminal, staring at the flashing red text on the departure board. He called travel agents and checked bus schedules, but every route was blocked or sold out. The two destinations he had dreamed of for so long were now completely unreachable.\n\nUsing a pair of correlative conjunctions (e.g., neither/nor, either/or, both/and) and the names of the cities, complete the sentence to describe the outcome of James's travel plans. List the cities in the order they appear in the passage.\n\nDue to the cancellations, James could visit __________.",
      "answer": "neither Paris nor Rome",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is \"neither Paris nor Rome\".\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Analyze the Text:** The passage states that flights to Paris were grounded and trains to Rome were halted. It concludes that both destinations were \"unreachable\" and every route was blocked. This establishes that James cannot visit Paris AND he cannot visit Rome.\n2. **Select the Correlative Conjunction:** The sentence stem (\"James could visit...\") uses a positive verb. To express a negative meaning (that he cannot go to either place) while maintaining the positive verb structure, the correlative pair \"neither ... nor\" is required. Using \"both ... and\" would imply he could go to both, and \"either ... or\" would imply he could choose one, both of which contradict the text.\n3. **Formulate the Phrase:** Combining the correct conjunctions with the cities in the order they appear in the text (Paris, then Rome) yields \"neither Paris nor Rome\".",

A single hive can contain thousands of bees, all working together for the survival of the group. Within this society, every member has a specific role determined by their type. The queen bee is the largest and most important figure; her primary task is to lay eggs to grow the population. Without her, the colony would cease to exist. Male bees, known as drones, have a different purpose; they exist solely to mate with the queen to ensure future generations. They do not have stingers and do not collect food. Finally, the worker bees are the smallest but most numerous group. These industrious females fly from the hive to gather nectar from blooming flowers, which they convert into honey. This distinct division of labor allows the honeybee community to thrive in various environments around the world.\n\nComplete the sentence below to describe the primary task of each bee type. Ensure your answer matches the grammatical structure of the list and uses correct punctuation.\n\nThe colony depends on laying eggs, mating __________.",

      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is ', and gathering nectar'. This question requires the student to identify the third item in a series based on the text and format it to match the parallel structure of the sentence. \n\n1. **Identify the item:** The passage lists the tasks for the three types of bees: the queen 'lay[s] eggs', the drones 'mate', and the workers 'gather nectar'.\n2. **Apply parallel structure:** The sentence stem uses gerunds ('laying', 'mating'). Therefore, the verb 'gather' from the text must be converted to 'gathering' to maintain consistency.\n3. **Apply punctuation rules:** Standard L.5.2.A requires the use of a comma before the conjunction ('and') when separating three or more items in a series. \n\nThus, the correctly punctuated and formatted completion is ', and gathering nectar'.",

Sarah and Ben had volunteered to organize the backstage area before the final dress rehearsal, but the task was proving to be more difficult than they had anticipated. Piles of faux medieval clothing lay mixed with futuristic helmets from a previous production, creating a confusing mound of fabric and plastic. Sarah sighed and picked up a clipboard that had been resting on a precariously balanced stack of books. She needed to verify that the inventory for the upcoming scenes was accurate. The director had been very strict about ensuring every item was accounted for by today. She scanned the handwritten notes, checking off items one by one. After a few minutes of silent reading, she wanted to confirm the status of the inventory with Ben, who was currently untangling a large coil of rope near the curtain. She looked up, pointed to the clipboard, and said, \"The list of necessary props for the second act is finalized__________\"\n\nBased on the grammar of the sentence, fill in the blank with the correct comma, the tag question using a contraction, and the ending punctuation.",
      "answer": ", isn't it?",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is \", isn't it?\" because the sentence requires a tag question to turn the statement into a question for confirmation. To form the correct tag question, you must first identify the subject and the verb of the main clause. The verb is \"is\" (from the phrase \"is finalized\"), so the tag must use the negative form \"isn't\" to balance the positive statement. The subject of the sentence is \"list\" (singular), not \"props\" (plural), because \"of necessary props\" is a prepositional phrase describing the list. Therefore, the pronoun must be \"it\" (singular) rather than \"they.\" Finally, standard L.5.2.C requires a comma to separate the statement from the tag question.",

Elias, the experienced trail guide, rode his horse back and forth along the uneven path, constantly checking for problems that could delay the group. He knew that reaching the Sweetwater River by nightfall was essential for the livestock. Near the back of the train, he noticed that the Miller family’s wagon had stopped completely, blocking the narrow path for the two wagons behind it. The oxen were grazing idly while Mr. Miller was examining a wobbly rear wheel with a furrowed brow. Elias trotted his horse over to the stationary wagon, looking concerned about the growing gap between them and the lead wagons. He knew he had to be firm to keep the group together. \"We have many miles left to cover today!\" Elias shouted over the noise of the wind and creaking wood. He leaned down from his saddle to ensure he was heard. \"I need you to keep moving Miller or we will not find fresh water before dark.\" Mr. Miller looked up, startled by the command, then nodded efficiently and quickly scrambled to finish his repair.\n\nIn the dialogue, Elias speaks directly to Mr. Miller.

Because the name \"Miller\" appears in the middle of the sentence (interrupting the clause \"keep moving... or we will not\"), it requires a comma before the name to separate it from \"moving\" and a comma after the name to separate it from \"or\".

      "question": "Sofia was finalizing her research paper on the famous author Rudyard Kipling. She had gathered multiple sources to ensure her bibliography was accurate. On her desk sat a heavy, hardcover edition of *The Jungle Book*, a classic collection that contained nearly two hundred pages of text. She had also watched the 2016 film adaptation of the same name to compare the visual storytelling with the written word. In the body of her paper, Sofia wanted to specifically analyze a narrative titled Rikki-Tikki-Tavi. This particular text began on page 87 of the hardcover book and ended on page 105. It was not published as a standalone book but served as one of several distinct tales included in the larger collection. Sofia paused, remembering that standard English conventions for titles depend on whether the work is a complete volume or just a component of one. While she had already italicized the title of the book, she needed to apply a different formatting rule to the title of the smaller text within it.\n\nTo conform to standard English conventions for short works found within larger volumes, Sofia should indicate the title Rikki-Tikki-Tavi by using __________.",
      "answer": "quotation marks",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is 'quotation marks'. To determine the correct formatting, the student must first analyze the passage to identify the type of work being described.

These details identify it as a short story or chapter rather than a full book. According to standard English conventions (L.5.2.D), titles of long, standalone works (like books and movies) are formatted with italics or underlining, while titles of short works (like short stories, poems, and chapters) are enclosed in quotation marks.

It is the largest living structure on Earth and stretches for more than 1,400 miles. Although it looks like lifeless rock from a distance, the reef is actually built by billions of tiny organisms. These small creatures are called coral polyps. They secrete a hard shell of calcium carbonate that builds up over thousands of years to form the reef structure. The ecosystem supports an incredible diversity of life, including whales, dolphins, and dugongs. More than 1,500 species of fish live among the colorful corals. The reef acts as a protective barrier for the coastline, shielding it from powerful ocean waves. Scientists study the reef to understand the health of the world's oceans. However, this delicate environment is under threat. Rising ocean temperatures have caused widespread coral bleaching events. Pollution from nearby farms also damages the water quality. Protecting this unique habitat requires global cooperation to reduce pollution and limit climate change.\n\n**Question:**\nRead the following two sentences from the passage:\n1. \"Although it looks like lifeless rock from a distance, the reef is actually built by billions of tiny organisms.\"\n2. \"These small creatures are called coral polyps.\"\n\nA writer combines these sentences into a single complex sentence:\n\n\"Although it looks like lifeless rock from a distance, the reef is actually built by billions of tiny organisms, __________ are called coral polyps.\"\n\nFill in the blank with the correct **relative pronoun** (one word).",
      "answer": "which",

Because this clause follows a comma and provides non-essential (extra) information about non-human subjects, the relative pronoun \"which\" is the required grammatically correct term.

      "question": "Read the passage below.\n\nThe ecosystem of the Great Barrier Reef is a marvel of biodiversity, hosting thousands of marine species in a vibrant underwater community. Coral polyps, the tiny architects of the reef, require precise conditions to thrive: clear water, specific temperatures, and abundant sunlight. For millennia, these organisms have built massive structures that protect coastlines and support fish populations. Recently, however, agricultural runoff from the mainland has introduced high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus into the water. While these nutrients might help crops grow on farms, their presence in the reef environment promotes the rapid growth of fleshy algae. This thick layer of vegetation smothers the reef, blocking the essential sunlight that corals need to synthesize energy and disrupting their delicate feeding processes. Marine biologists have confirmed that this pollution has a **detrimental** effect on the coral's health, directly linking the runoff to widespread coral death.\n\nBased on the description of how the runoff smothers the reef and causes coral death, the word **detrimental** in the passage most likely means __________.",
      "answer": "harmful",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is \"harmful\". To determine the meaning of the word \"detrimental,\" the reader must analyze the cause-and-effect relationships described in the text. First, the passage presents a contrast using the word \"While\": nutrients help crops on farms, but in the reef, they cause algae to grow rapidly. The text then details the negative consequences of this growth, stating that it \"smothers the reef,\" blocks \"essential sunlight,\" and disrupts feeding. Finally, the passage links the pollution to \"widespread coral death.\" These context clues collectively describe an effect that causes injury or destruction.

      "question": "Read the passage below.\n\nEcosystems are generally resilient, meaning they can recover from small disturbances naturally. A healthy lake can clear up after a minor chemical spill, and a forest can slowly regrow after a localized storm damages some trees. However, this natural ability to bounce back has a specific limit. To understand this, imagine a rubber band being stretched. You can pull it slightly, and it immediately returns to its original shape. You can pull it harder, and it still snaps back. But if you stretch it beyond its physical limit, the rubber breaks completely. In environmental science, this critical threshold is known as a \"tipping point.\" Once an environment is pushed past this specific stage, it creates a new reality and cannot go back to how it was before. For instance, if a rainforest loses a large percentage of its trees, the local moisture cycle breaks, and the humid land dries out into a grassy savanna. Even if humans try to plant new trees later, the conditions have changed too much for them to survive. The original forest is gone forever.\n\nBased on the analogy of the rubber band and the forest example, the phrase \"tipping point\" implies that the change to the ecosystem has become __________.",
      "answer": "permanent",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is \"permanent\". The passage uses context clues to define the phrase \"tipping point.\" First, it contrasts the concept with being \"resilient\" (bouncing back). Second, it uses an analogy of a rubber band that \"breaks completely\" when pulled too far. Finally, it provides a real-world example stating that the forest \"cannot go back\" and is \"gone forever.\" Synthesizing these clues—breaking completely, inability to return, and being gone forever—leads to the conclusion that the change is no longer temporary, but permanent. The word \"forever\" appears in the text as an adverb, but the sentence structure (\"has become __________\") requires the adjective \"permanent.\"",

Inside, explorers eventually found a massive **subterranean** world that is large enough to house an entire city block with forty-story skyscrapers. This colossal cavern contains its own fast-flowing river, a localized weather system with clouds, and a thriving jungle where sunlight filters through collapsed sections of the roof. The environment is completely isolated from the outside world, creating a unique ecosystem. Scientists and adventurers travel great distances to study this dark, enclosed space, marveling at how life has adapted to thrive in the depths of the stone. The sheer size of the chambers and the intricate rock formations make it one of the most significant geological discoveries of modern times.\n\nThe word **subterranean** is formed from the prefix *sub-*, meaning \"under\" or \"below,\" and the root *terra*, meaning \"earth.\" Based on these clues and the passage, the word **subterranean** describes the cave's location as being __________.",

      "question": "Read the passage.\n\nIn the study of ancient mythology, historians often analyze the quests of great heroes. These stories frequently feature a search for magical items that grant extraordinary powers to those who possess them. One of the most famous examples is the legend of the Golden Apples. According to the myths, these shining fruits were guarded by a dragon in a secret garden at the edge of the world. While ordinary humans are bound by nature to age, weaken, and eventually pass away, the legends claimed that the Golden Apples held a different fate for the consumer. It was believed that eating just one of these apples would prevent a person from ever reaching the end of their life. By consuming the fruit, a human could become *immortal*, remaining young and powerful while centuries and even millennia passed by around them. Kings and warriors traveled vast distances, hoping to escape the natural cycle of life and death, but few ever succeeded in finding the garden.\n\nThe word *immortal* is formed from the prefix *im-*, meaning \"not,\" and the Latin root *mort*, meaning \"death.\" Based on the power of the Golden Apples described in the passage, an *immortal* person is one who will live __________.",
      "answer": "forever",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is \"forever.\" The question provides the clue that the root *mort* means \"death\" and the prefix *im-* means \"not,\" indicating that *immortal* literally means \"not subject to death.\" The passage supports this by stating that the apples would \"prevent a person from ever reaching the end of their life\" and allow them to exist while \"centuries and even millennia passed by.\" By synthesizing the root definition (no death) with the context clues (never ending life), the reader can determine that an immortal person lives forever.",

The blank white page staring up from his desk was a steep, snowy cliff that offered no easy way to ascend. He gripped his pencil until his knuckles turned white, searching for a single idea to use as a rope, but his mind remained a vast, empty canyon. The ticking clock was a cold wind chilling his confidence, reminding him of how far he had to go. He considered giving up and retreating to the safety of an easier subject.\n\nThen, almost by accident, he scrawled one sentence: \"The ancient dragon opened its golden eye.\" Suddenly, he found a foothold. Then another. One sentence seemed to pull the next one up after it. He wasn't just hanging on anymore; he was hiking steadily upward. His pencil moved faster, carving a path through the snow.

He owned a reliable hardware store, served on the town council, and had cultivated a deep network of friends he had known since grade school. His historic home was filled with comfortable furniture, framed photographs, and family heirlooms that told the story of a steady, consistent life.\n\nBen, on the other hand, was driven by a restless spirit. He traveled incessantly from coast to coast, picking up temporary work as a waiter, a farmhand, or a deckhand, never remaining in one location for more than six months. He carried his entire life in a single, battered duffel bag and rarely kept in touch with anyone he met along the way.\n\nOne rainy afternoon, Ben arrived at Arthur’s doorstep, soaking wet and looking for a place to crash. Over dinner, he entertained Arthur’s family with thrilling tales of storms at sea and mountain treks. However, when Ben admitted he had no plans for the future and no permanent address, Arthur sighed deeply. Later that night, Arthur whispered to his wife, “I worry about him. They say a rolling stone gathers no moss.”\n\nBased on the contrast between the two brothers in the passage, Arthur uses the proverb \"a rolling stone gathers no moss\" to suggest that Ben's constant traveling prevents him from achieving __________.",

While Ben moves freely, he fails to gather \"moss,\" which metaphorically represents the tangible and intangible benefits of staying in one place.

      "question": "Read the passage below.\n\nIn the mid-1800s, the California Gold Rush drew thousands of people hoping to find their fortune. In their haste, inexperienced miners often discovered rocks that sparkled brightly in the riverbeds. These stones were actually pyrite, a common mineral composed of iron and sulfur. Unlike real gold, which is soft and heavy, pyrite is brittle and lighter. Because pyrite mimicked the bright gleam of the precious metal, many miners wasted days collecting it, only to find out later that their \"wealth\" was worthless. This scenario illustrates the wisdom of the proverb, \"All that glitters is not gold.\"\n\nBased on the passage, this proverb suggests that a person should not judge the value of something solely by its outward __________.",

      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is \"appearance\". The passage explains that miners were fooled because pyrite visually resembled real gold but lacked its actual value.

The Great Stone Temple in the center of the city was designed to be **perpetual**. Its massive granite blocks were fitted together without mortar, creating walls intended to survive through centuries of harsh winds and changing history. This structure represented the kingdom’s desire for an everlasting legacy.\n\nIn stark contrast, the annual Festival of Frost was a celebration of the **transient**. For this event, master carvers shaped intricate figures from blocks of river ice, fully aware that their masterpieces would melt away within just a few hours of the morning sunrise. The citizens gathered in the square to admire these delicate, shimmering creations, cherishing them precisely because they would soon dissolve into puddles. While the temple provided a sense of stability and endless time, the ice sculptures reminded the people that some forms of beauty are special specifically because they do not stay.\n\nBased on the passage's contrast between the 'perpetual' temple and the ice sculptures, the word 'transient' is best defined as __________.",

On the other hand, 'transient' is associated with the ice sculptures and defined by clues describing things that 'melt away within just a few hours,' 'soon dissolve,' and 'do not stay.' By analyzing this antonym relationship, the student must infer that 'transient' means lasting for only a limited time.

This process occurs mainly in the leaves of plants, specifically within small structures called chloroplasts. These structures contain chlorophyll, a green pigment that is responsible for absorbing light energy from the sun. When sunlight hits the leaves, the chlorophyll captures it. The plant then uses this trapped energy to convert water from the soil and carbon dioxide from the air into glucose, a type of sugar. This glucose serves as the primary source of food and energy for the plant, allowing it to grow and repair itself. As a byproduct of this reaction, plants release oxygen back into the atmosphere, which is vital for the survival of humans and other animals. Without this continuous cycle, life on Earth as we know it would not be possible.\"\n\n**Student's Note:**\n\"Inside the leaves, chlorophyll traps sunlight and uses that power to change water and carbon dioxide into sugar for food and oxygen for the air.\"\n\nThe student's note restates the information from the passage using different words while maintaining the specific details.

One by one, hands shot up into the air. Mrs. Robinson scanned the room, counting aloud. She looked for any students keeping their hands down, but there were none. Even the students who had initially argued for the museum raised their hands in support.

The first role is played by green plants and algae, which capture solar energy to synthesize their own food. The second role involves animals like beetles, jays, and mountain lions, which cannot make their own food and must ingest other organisms to survive. However, the ecosystem relies heavily on a third, often invisible workforce operating on the damp ground. When trees shed leaves or animals die, organic material piles up. This is where organisms such as shelf fungi, earthworms, and bacteria take action. Unlike the other groups, they feed on decaying matter, chemically breaking it down into simple nitrates and phosphates. This process recycles essential nutrients back into the soil, allowing the green plants to grow and starting the cycle anew. Without this final group, the forest would be buried under waste, and the soil would become barren.\n\nBased on the passage, the scientific term for the group of organisms that recycles nutrients by breaking down dead matter is __________.",

      "question": "Read the passage about an invasive plant species.\n\nIn 1876, a climbing vine called Kudzu was introduced to the United States from Japan during a grand exhibition. Gardeners initially admired its broad, heart-shaped leaves and sweet-smelling purple flowers, planting it widely for decoration and to help anchor the soil. However, they soon discovered that the vine grew at an alarming rate—sometimes up to a foot in a single day during the summer. This rapid expansion allowed Kudzu to engulf entire forests, climbing over trees, telephone poles, and abandoned buildings. By blocking the sunlight that other plants needed to survive, Kudzu caused native vegetation to die, throwing local ecosystems completely off balance.\n\nTo deal with this aggressive \"green invader,\" landowners and government agencies have had to devise creative strategies. Frequent mowing is one common method used to keep the vines at bay, though it is labor-intensive and must be repeated constantly. More recently, some communities have hired herds of goats to graze on the overgrown land. Unlike machines, these hungry animals can easily navigate steep hills and thick brush. They eat the vines down to the ground, effectively clearing the area without the need for harmful herbicides that could damage the surrounding environment.\n\nThe passage moves from describing the ecological threat posed by Kudzu to the various strategies used to control its spread. This specific text structure is known as __________.",

The first paragraph describes the issue: Kudzu grows too fast, kills native plants, and disrupts ecosystems (the \"problem\"). The second paragraph details the methods used to manage the vine, such as mowing and using goats (the \"solution\"). \n\nWhile the first paragraph contains cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., blocking sunlight causes plants to die), the *overall* structure of the entire text is \"problem and solution\" because the primary purpose is to present a difficulty and describe how it is being addressed.",

This natural glow is found in a variety of species, from mushrooms in damp forests to strange creatures in the deep ocean. Although the chemistry often involves a molecule called luciferin reacting with oxygen, the function of this light varies dramatically among species. On warm summer evenings, fireflies flash distinct patterns in the air, turning trees into sparkling displays of communication. These signals are a language of attraction, designed to help males and females identify appropriate mates amidst the foliage. Conversely, the deep-sea anglerfish utilizes its glow for a more deceptive purpose. Drifting in the total darkness of the abyss, the female anglerfish dangles a bioluminescent lure from a rod on her forehead. She wiggles this glowing bait to mimic a small worm. When a smaller fish approaches in hopes of a meal, it is instantly snatched up by the anglerfish’s massive, tooth-filled jaws.\n\nBased on the passage, the word \"conversely\" is used to signal a relationship of __________ between the firefly's purpose for glowing and the anglerfish's purpose.",

A giant steel tank owned by the Purity Distilling Company, filled with over two million gallons of molasses, suddenly ruptured. The rivets popped like gunfire, and the tank collapsed. In popular culture, the phrase \"slow as molasses\" suggests that the syrup moves sluggishly and poses little physical threat. Under normal conditions, this thick, dark liquid creeps along at a snail's pace, making it easy to avoid. Consequently, residents might have assumed a leak would be merely sticky and inconvenient. Yet, the physics of the sudden collapse created a terrifyingly different outcome. The wave of molasses stood twenty-five feet tall and rushed through the streets at an estimated 35 miles per hour. The force was so intense that it demolished buildings, overturned vehicles, and bent steel girders. While the substance itself remained thick, the sheer volume and energy released by the tank's failure transformed the normally harmless syrup into a deadly, high-speed force.\n\nBased on the text, the word \"Yet\" signals a logical relationship of __________ between the typical nature of molasses and the events of the disaster.",
      "answer": "contrast",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is \"contrast\". The passage begins by describing the typical behavior of molasses, noting that it moves \"at a snail's pace\" and is generally harmless. The transition word \"Yet\" introduces the opposing information that, during this specific disaster, the molasses moved at \"35 miles per hour\" and was a deadly force. The word \"Yet\" functions to signal a contrast (or difference) between the expectation of slowness and the reality of high speed.",

Picture morning arrival transformed: students chatting with neighbors as they stroll tree-lined sidewalks, arriving alert and energized rather than drowsy from a cramped bus ride. While some parents cite safety concerns or distance as barriers, organized 'walking school buses'—groups led by adult volunteers—address these issues while building neighborhood connections.

Marcus stood framed in the doorway, a silhouette of misery. He was shivering so violently that his keys jingled in his pocket. His heavy wool coat was soaked through to the skin, his boots were caked with layers of slush and mud, and his brand-new knit hat was nowhere to be found, likely claimed by the storm. He had left the safety of the house over two hours ago with the simple goal of picking up a pepperoni pizza for movie night.\n\nAcross the room, his brother Tyrell sat comfortably on the plush velvet couch, wrapped like a burrito in a thick fleece blanket. A mug of steaming hot cocoa rested in his hand, and the fireplace crackled cheerfully beside him, casting a warm orange glow on his face. Tyrell lowered his comic book and looked up, eyeing the puddle of dirty water rapidly forming around Marcus’s feet and the conspicuously empty hands where the pizza boxes should have been.\n\n\"Well,\" Tyrell said, settling deeper into the cushions and taking a slow, deliberate sip of his cocoa. \"Don't you look like the picture of absolute triumph. I assume the pizza is invisible?\"\n\nMarcus glared, wiping a clump of wet hair from his eyes. \"The car broke down a mile away. I had to walk. Uphill. In this blizzard.\"\n\nTyrell smiled sweetly. \"Sounds like a wonderful adventure. I’m sure you enjoyed every minute of that refreshing winter stroll.\"\n\nTyrell uses positive words like \"wonderful\" and \"refreshing\" to describe a miserable situation.

Second, the reader must contrast this reality with Tyrell's literal words in the final sentence, such as \"wonderful adventure\" and \"refreshing winter stroll.\" Since these positive words directly contradict Marcus's negative experience, Tyrell is saying the opposite of what he means to mock his brother.

Additionally, the bulky equipment and extensive wiring require significant roof space and structural modifications that are impossible for many apartment dwellers or homes with shaded lots.\n\nStatement:\nThe passage has two main ideas: (1) home solar panels provide environmental and financial benefits to households, and (2) home solar panels face significant practical obstacles that limit their adoption.

This ability is found in various organisms, from fungi on the forest floor to creatures in the deepest parts of the ocean. While the chemical process is similar, the reasons animals use this light vary dramatically.\n\nConsider the firefly, a common beetle found in backyards. Fireflies flash distinctive patterns to locate and attract mates, ensuring their species continues to the next generation. In contrast, the deep-sea anglerfish uses light for a much darker purpose. Living in the pitch-black depths, it dangles a glowing lure from its head. Smaller fish are drawn to the glow, mistaking it for food, only to be snapped up by the anglerfish. This adaptation allows the anglerfish to secure meals in an environment where food is scarce.\n\nConversely, the vampire squid uses light for protection. When threatened by a predator, it does not fight back. Instead, it ejects a cloud of glowing mucus that startles and confuses the attacker. This dazzling display buys the squid precious seconds to escape into the shadows. While the firefly uses light for reproduction, the anglerfish and vampire squid use it to solve immediate life-or-death challenges, helping them persist in their dangerous environments.\"\n\nBy explaining how the anglerfish captures prey and the vampire squid evades predators, the author supports the point that bioluminescence is a tool for individual __________.",
      "answer": "survival",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is \"survival\". To arrive at this answer, the student must analyze the specific evidence provided in the text regarding the anglerfish and the vampire squid. The text states that the anglerfish uses light to \"secure meals\" (feeding) and the vampire squid uses light to \"escape\" predators (defense). The student must synthesize these two different functions—eating and avoiding being eaten—into a single overarching concept. While the text mentions \"reproduction\" for fireflies, the question specifically asks about the anglerfish and squid, whose actions are necessary for the individual organism to stay alive. Therefore, the point supported by this evidence is that bioluminescence aids in survival.

Just last month, the village elders had labeled her father a \"panicked old fool\" after he signaled a false alarm for a storm that veered away. Elara knew that one more error would destroy his remaining credibility. A massive swell smashed against the wall, shaking the floorboards beneath her boots. The responsibility felt heavier than the stone blocks of the tower itself. Her instinct screamed to pull the lever, but the memory of the elders’ ridicule froze her hand. The village slept in silence, unaware of the danger rising in the dark. Elara felt her heart hammering a rhythm of indecision.

Through the open window, she could hear the distant sound of drums—the Harvest Festival had already begun. If she hurried, she could finish the vase and still catch the opening ceremony. Her hands moved swiftly, pulling the walls of the clay up into a tall, slender shape. It looked elegant, though the walls were dangerously thin. \"Good enough,\" she whispered, deciding to skip the recommended slow-drying period. She placed the vase directly on the sunny windowsill where the heat was most intense, hoping it would harden quickly.\n\nAn hour later, Elara returned, her festival cloak already over her shoulders. Her heart sank. A spiderweb of fine fractures marred the surface of the pot. The clay had dried too rapidly in the harsh sun, causing it to crack under the stress. It was ruined. With a heavy sigh, she crushed the dry clay back into the recycling bin and sat back down at the wheel. She removed her cloak. This time, she breathed deeply and worked the wheel at a steady, moderate pace. When the new form was complete, she carefully covered it with a damp cloth and set it in the cool, dark corner of the workshop to cure overnight. She knew she would miss the fireworks, but as she looked at the smooth, damp clay, she knew this one would survive the kiln.\n\nElara's failure with the first vase and success with the second demonstrates the theme that true craftsmanship requires __________.",

In the second attempt, she worked at a 'steady, moderate pace,' used a 'damp cloth' (which slows drying), and let it cure 'overnight' despite missing the fireworks.

HUAN (an older neighbor)\n\n**ELIAS:** (Throws down his gloves) \"It’s useless, Mr. Huan. We’ve been pulling weeds for three hours and the garden still looks like a jungle. I quit.\"\n\n**MR. HUAN:** (Calmly continues working) \"Look at the path behind us, Elias. It is clear. We are not trying to fix the whole garden in one minute. We are just fixing this square foot.\"\n\n**ELIAS:** \"But it will take forever! We'll never finish.\"\n\n**MR. HUAN:** \"Time will pass anyway. If we stop, the weeds grow back. If we keep working, the tomatoes will finally have room to grow. The only way to really fail is to stop trying.\"\n\n**ELIAS:** (Looks at the clear path, then the weeds. He picks up his gloves.) \"Okay. One more row.\"\n\nBased on how the characters respond to the challenge of the overgrown garden, the drama develops the theme that __________ is necessary to achieve difficult goals.",
      "answer": "perseverance",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is 'perseverance'. The drama presents a challenge where Elias feels overwhelmed and wants to give up. However, Mr. Huan provides the opposing viewpoint that steady, continued effort ('keep working') is the only way to succeed. Elias's final decision to pick up his gloves and continue despite the difficulty confirms that the central lesson is about not giving up. While 'hard work' is involved, the specific focus on overcoming the desire to quit points to 'perseverance' as the precise thematic noun.",

As the heavy curtain rose, Maya stood center stage, feeling smaller than she ever had before. The spotlight was a blinding sun, heating her skin and exposing her to the hundreds of judging eyes in the darkness beyond. For a terrifying moment, her mind was a blank whiteboard, wiped completely clean of the lines she had rehearsed for weeks. She could see Mrs. Halloway in the front row, leaning forward with a hopeful smile, but that only made the pressure heavier. The silence in the room stretched thin, a rubber band pulled to its absolute breaking point, waiting for someone to snap it. Maya’s heart hammered against her ribs like a trapped bird desperate to escape. She squeezed her eyes shut, took a shaky breath, and forced herself to visualize the script sitting on her desk at home. Finally, the first word of her monologue drifted into focus.\n\nBased on the passage, the comparison of the silence to a 'rubber band' suggests that the atmosphere in the room was filled with __________.",

While Maya feels fear, the room itself—filled with judging eyes and people waiting for her to speak—is characterized by the strain of waiting for a resolution. In literature, this mood of unreleased stress and anticipation is defined as 'tension.'",

He knelt and undid the rusted latches with a sharp click. There it was—the mahogany violin, its finish dull and scratched, its strings snapped and coiled like withered vines.

The silence of the attic seemed to press against his ears, a heavy weight compared to the glory of his past.\n\n*Section 2: The Grand Hall*\nThe spotlight was hot against his face, blinding him to the sea of people seated in the darkness beyond the stage. Young Elias adjusted his grip on the smooth, polished neck of the instrument. He took a deep breath, smelling the rosin on his bow and the faint scent of floor wax. He nodded to the conductor. As his arm moved, the violin sang—a crisp, vibrant melody that soared to the high vaulted ceiling. Every note was perfect, strong, and full of life. When he lowered the bow, the silence hung for a split second before shattering into a roar of applause and cheers that made the floorboards vibrate beneath his feet.\n\nBased on the content of the two sections, the author uses a structural device known as a __________ in the second section to reveal the history of the violin.",

He kept glancing at the old radio on the mantelpiece, willing it to make a sound. Static hissed, but no voices came through. He tightened his grip on the flashlight. \"Just wait,\" he whispered to himself. \"They said they’d call by noon.\" The clock struck two. The silence from the radio was louder than the storm.\n\n**Chapter 2: The Promise**\nThree days earlier, the sun had been shining. Leo stood on the dock as his father boarded the small boat. \"The radio is old,\" his father had said, handing him a spare battery. \"But I promise I'll check in every day at noon. If you don't hear from me, stay in the cabin.\" Leo had nodded, watching the boat cut a white path through the blue water until it was just a speck. He felt a knot of worry even then.\n\n**Chapter 3: The Signal**\nA sudden crackle broke the silence in the cabin. Leo jumped, nearly dropping the flashlight. Through the static, a faint voice emerged. \"Leo... safe... coming back.\" The knot in Leo's chest loosened. He slumped back into the chair, the fire finally feeling warm on his face. The storm raged on, but the fear was gone.\n\nIn terms of narrative structure, Chapter 2 acts as a __________ because it interrupts the chronological events of the storm to reveal a scene from the past.",

They called the new railroad a silver ribbon that would bind the nation together, bringing wealth and ease to our doorstep. But standing on the porch where I had spent fifty years watching corn rise from the soil, I saw no glory. When the iron monster finally arrived, it didn't glide; it tore through the valley with gnashing teeth.

While the surveyors congratulated themselves on conquering the landscape, I could only watch in silence as their machine waged war on the only peace I had ever known.\n\nWhile the city men describe the railroad as a 'silver ribbon,' the narrator's opposing point of view leads him to describe the train as an 'iron __________.'",

      "question": "Read the transcript of a discussion between two students, Jayden and Chloe, analyzing a story they read in class.\n\n**Jayden:** \"I’m trying to figure out why Elara acted so strangely in Chapter 3. After she accidentally knocked over the vase, she didn’t just hide the pieces. She spent the entire afternoon scrubbing the floors, dusting the shelves, and organizing the pantry.\"\n\n**Chloe:** \"I noticed that too. It was a complete change from her normal behavior. Usually, Elara complains about doing even the smallest chores and tries to get out of them. But this time, she volunteered to do everything, even the laundry. It seemed like she was trying to balance out a scale.\"\n\n**Jayden:** \"Exactly. And remember the scene at dinner? When her dad asked her how her day was, the author wrote that Elara 'stared at her plate' and 'mumbled a short answer.' She couldn't even look him in the eye.\"\n\n**Chloe:** \"That body language is a huge clue. If she were just afraid of being punished, she might have hidden in her room or made up a lie to protect herself. But the fact that she was performing acts of service suggests she felt a deep need to fix the mistake herself.\"\n\n**Jayden:** \"Right. She wanted to be 'good' to cancel out the 'bad' thing she did. It wasn’t just fear of getting in trouble; it was that she knew she had done something wrong and felt terrible about it.\"\n\nBased on the discussion, the students conclude that Elara's sudden helpfulness and inability to make eye contact were driven by her overwhelming sense of __________.",
      "answer": "guilt",

The discussion requires the student to synthesize multiple pieces of evidence: Elara's uncharacteristic cleaning ('balancing a scale'), her avoidance of eye contact, and Jayden's specific distinction that her motivation was 'not just fear' but a realization that she 'had done something wrong.' These clues collectively point to the internal emotion of guilt.

      "question": "In Mr. Henderson’s fifth-grade ELA class, students engage in writing tasks with varying time constraints to build a range of skills. For 'Sprint Sessions,' the timer is set to exactly fifteen minutes. The rule is simple: keep the pencil moving. Students might describe a sudden storm or a character’s reaction to a surprise. During these short intervals, there is no time to stop and look back; the primary goal is fluency and getting raw ideas down on paper quickly.\n\nIn contrast, the 'Author’s Workshop' is a project that spans two full weeks. Students select a complex topic, such as 'The Importance of Bees' or 'The History of the Wheel,' and develop it fully. During this extended time frame, they follow a rigorous multi-step process. After gathering facts and writing a rough draft, they spend specific days focusing on different types of improvements. On Day 6, for example, a student named Leo re-read his draft and noticed his second paragraph did not support his main idea. He decided to delete a confusing sentence, rephrase the explanation to make it clearer, and add a stronger example to support his argument. It was not until Day 8 that he focused solely on checking for capitalized proper nouns and correct end marks.\n\nBased on the passage, the specific stage of the writing process Leo performed on Day 6, involving changes to content and organization, is known as __________.",
      "answer": "revision",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is **revision**. To determine this, the student must analyze the two distinct phases of improvement described in the passage. On Day 8, Leo focuses on mechanical correctness, such as capitalization and punctuation; this stage is known as **editing** or proofreading. On Day 6, however, Leo focuses on the 'content and organization' of his work by deleting confusing sentences, rephrasing ideas, and adding examples to support his argument. In the writing process (and specifically in the extended time frames described in Standard W.5.10), the stage dedicated to improving ideas, structure, and clarity is called **revision**.",

Thousands of miles away in the deep blue ocean, a humpback whale produces a complex pattern of moans and cries. These haunting sounds can travel for miles underwater, allowing the whale to connect with other members of its pod in the vast darkness. Meanwhile, on a busy sidewalk in a city park, a tiny worker ant bumps into a fellow colony member. They pause and tap their antennae together, exchanging chemical scents that reveal the precise location of a dropped crumb of bread.\n\nWhile these creatures are vastly different in size and habitat, they all use specific methods to share information with others of their kind.

Option B is incorrect due to faulty parallelism; the phrase 'not only' introduces an infinitive ('to bake'), so the phrase after 'but also' should match that structure, but 'creating' is a gerund.

It was a minor annoyance, requiring a firm jiggle to lock, but he was always in a rush to catch the school bus. \"I'll get the screwdriver and tighten it this weekend,\" he promised himself. A week later, a strong gust of wind blew the unsecured gate violently against the fence, snapping the hinges and splintering the wood.

In the passage, tightening the loose latch immediately would have saved Jerome from having to replace the entire broken gate. Option A is incorrect because it applies a literal interpretation to the number \"nine.\" Option C is incorrect because, while Jerome was rushing, the proverb specifically addresses the consequence of delaying repairs, not the cause of his hurry (which would be better described by \"haste makes waste\").

First, she states that the bags harm wildlife; local volunteers removed 1,100 plastic bags from a riverbank where several turtles were found entangled. Second, she explains that producing plastic bags wastes resources, estimating that manufacturing just one ton of plastic bags consumes 11 barrels of oil and 20,000 gallons of water and releases over two tons of carbon dioxide. She further notes that although the bags can technically be recycled, nationwide only 9% actually are, so the resources used to make them are rarely recovered. Finally, Ms. Chan claims that reusable alternatives are practical; in neighboring Riverdale, 93% of shoppers switched to cloth totes within a month of the bag ban, and store operating costs remained unchanged.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich pairing of one of Ms. Chan’s points with the evidence that supports it is accurate according to the excerpt?",

Additionally, parks strengthen community bonds. Neighborhoods with active park programs report 40% higher rates of residents knowing their neighbors by name. Furthermore, parks support urban wildlife.

Every morning, she found the ceramic figure in a different spot and blamed the wind or stray cats. Determined to find the truth, Liam watched from his window as the sun began to rise. He saw Mr. Henderson, the grumpy neighbor known for yelling at kids to stay off his lawn, tiptoeing into Mrs. Gable’s yard. Mr. Henderson gently lifted the gnome, which had been knocked over by the wind. He wiped the dirt from its red hat and placed it securely on the porch steps, away from the muddy grass. Then, he hurried back to his own house, looking over his shoulder.\n\nWhich sentence from the text best supports the inference that Mr. Henderson is acting out of kindness rather than mischief?",
      "answer": "C",
      "answer_explanation": "Option C is the correct answer because it describes specific actions ('wiped the dirt,' 'placed it securely') that demonstrate care and a desire to protect the object from damage, which directly supports the inference of kindness. Option A is incorrect because it highlights Mr. Henderson's negative reputation ('grumpy,' 'yelling') and suspicious movement ('tiptoeing'), which would suggest mischief or hostility to a surface-level reader. Option B explains the context of the mystery but offers no evidence regarding Mr. Henderson's specific motivation.

      "question": "Read the story.\n\nElara stared at the jagged peak of Mount Kestrel. She had trained all summer for this climb, and the summit was finally within reach. Suddenly, Ben, a newer climber in their group, slipped on loose shale. He grimaced, clutching his ankle. \"I can’t put weight on it,\" he whispered.\n\nThe guide checked his watch. \"We’re losing light. One person needs to help Ben down slowly. The rest can still make the summit if we leave now.\"\n\nElara looked at the peak, then at Ben’s pale face. Her friends shifted their packs, waiting for someone to volunteer. With a heavy sigh, Elara stepped back from the group. \"I’ll take him,\" she said.\n\nLater, at the base camp, the group returned, shouting about the incredible view. Elara felt a sharp pang of jealousy looking at their photos. Then Ben limped over and handed her a warm mug. \"I would have been stuck up there without you,\" he said earnestly. \"You’re the real hero today.\"\n\nElara looked at the mountain one last time, then at Ben. The jealousy faded, replaced by a quiet warmth in her chest.\n\nWhich sentence best states the theme of the story?",
      "answer": "B",
      "answer_explanation": "Option B is the correct answer because it captures the central message revealed through the character's conflict and resolution. Elara faces a choice between her personal goal (the summit) and helping someone in need (Ben). Although she initially feels jealousy, her final reaction—feeling 'quiet warmth' after realizing the value of her help—demonstrates the lesson that helping others is a meaningful form of success. Option A is incorrect because it focuses on a plot detail (the accident) rather than the deeper meaning. Option C is incorrect because it suggests a theme of persistence that contradicts Elara's decision to stop her climb. Option D is incorrect because, while Elara briefly feels jealousy, the story ends with her overcoming that feeling, meaning the story does not support the idea that resentment is the final result.",

But every time the tower reached two feet, it wobbled and crashed. Across the room, Sarah and Marcus were laughing as they adjusted their bridge design. They weren't hiding their work; they were combining ideas. Liam sighed, looking at his scattered blocks. He glanced at Julian, who was sitting alone with a sketchbook full of structural diagrams but no blocks. Liam took a deep breath and walked over. \"Hey, Julian, I have the blocks, but my design is weak. You have the plans. Want to team up?\" By the end of the hour, their tower stood tall and steady.

The noise of the audience buzzing is heard through the curtain. Kara holds her violin, looking pale. A loose string hangs from the instrument.*\n\n**KARA:** (Voice trembling) Look at this! The E-string snapped while I was tuning. I can’t play the “Concerto in G” on three strings. It needs the high notes!\n\n**JAY:** (Checking his watch) You’re on in two minutes. Do you have a spare string?\n\n**KARA:** No! I left my case in the music room, and it’s locked. I should just go home. I’m not going out there to look like a fool.\n\n**JAY:** (Steps in front of her to block the exit) You’ve practiced every day for months.

Option B is incorrect because while Kara is stressed, the story focuses on how she *overcomes* the stress, not just the fact that stress exists. Option C is incorrect because it is a practical lesson specific to the plot details (a summary of what went wrong), not the abstract moral or message of the story.

Buster ignored him, pulling hard to chase a squirrel and twisting the leash around Elias’s legs. The session ended with Elias dusting dirt off his jeans, frustrated and defeated. The next morning, Elias tried a different plan in the quiet of his backyard. He hid the leash in his pocket and held out a small treat. He didn't shout. Instead, he whispered, \"Sit,\" and waited. Buster’s ears perked up. The dog sat immediately, his eyes fixed on the food.

Furthermore, the final sentence states Elias's realization that his 'demand for control' caused the failure, confirming that the difference in approach (force vs. rewards) was the primary cause of the different outcomes. Option A is incorrect because the text states Buster 'ignored' Elias, which implies the dog heard the command but chose not to obey; it does not say he couldn't hear. Option C is incorrect because the text attributes the success to the change in method (treats/whispering), not to the dog being tired.

The silence in the waiting room wrapped around her like a heavy wool blanket in the middle of a heatwave.

      "answer": "B",
      "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct. This question requires multi-step reasoning to interpret the figurative language. First, the student must analyze the imagery: a 'heavy wool blanket' is usually comforting, but the addition of 'in the middle of a heatwave' changes the meaning to something unbearable, hot, and suffocating. Second, the student must apply this quality to the 'silence.' The text supports this interpretation with context clues like 'sweaty hands,' 'pulled at her collar,' and 'no air left.' Therefore, the silence felt oppressive and uncomfortable. Option A is incorrect because it relies on the common positive association with blankets (comfort) while ignoring the context of the 'heatwave.' Option C is incorrect because it interprets the blanket literally as a way to stay warm. Option D is incorrect because it assumes the blanket's function is to cover or block sound, which contradicts the suffocating nature of the specific imagery used.",

Option A is incorrect because it interprets the metaphor literally; the clock was not actually making loud banging noises like a real hammer.

A flyer for the school play hangs on the wall.]\n**JASPER:** (Sighs while looking at the flyer) I really want to try out for the role of Captain Hook in *Peter Pan*, but I’ve never acted before. I'm afraid I'll freeze up.\n**LILA:** You’re funny and loud in class. You’d be great! You just need to practice your lines.\n\n**Scene 2**\n[Setting: Jasper’s living room. Jasper holds a script. Lila sits on the sofa.]\n**JASPER:** (Takes a deep breath) \"I am Captain Hook! Fear my hook!\"\n**LILA:** That was good, but try to sound scarier. Like a real pirate.\n**JASPER:** Okay, let me try again. (He stands taller and speaks with a growl) \"Fear my hook!\"\n**LILA:** Perfect!

Option B is incorrect because, although the rolls are burnt, the narrator views them as treasures, not ruined mistakes.

      "question": "Read the passage.\n\nMost people hurried past the jagged iron gates of the Blackwood Estate, seeing only a crumbling wreck where weeds strangled the roses. But I didn't see a wreck. I saw a sleeping giant waiting to wake up. As I pushed open the groaning front door, others might have heard a warning screech. I heard a greeting. The peeling wallpaper wasn't messy; it was like the shedding skin of a reptile, revealing the sturdy bones of the house underneath. I tightened my grip on my toolbox. I wasn't here to condemn the place; I was here to save it.\n\nHow does the narrator’s point of view influence the description of the Blackwood Estate?",
      "answer": "B",
      "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct. The narrator approaches the house with the intent to 'save' it, which influences the description by turning negative details into positive metaphors. For example, he describes the 'groaning' door as a 'greeting' and the 'peeling wallpaper' as 'shedding skin' that reveals 'sturdy bones,' portraying the house as a living thing with potential rather than a ruin. Option A is incorrect because the narrator mentions the neighbors' fear only to contrast it with his own confidence; he does not describe the house through their fearful lens. Option C is incorrect because the description is highly subjective and poetic (e.g., 'sleeping giant'), not an objective list of damages. Option D is incorrect because the narrator explicitly rejects the suspenseful or dangerous interpretation that 'others' might have, viewing the sounds and sights as welcoming.",

This perspective influences the description, leading the narrator to focus on negative details like the 'heavy' air, the beetle looking like an 'oil slick,' and the 'skittering' movements.

The troll eats the pie, smiles, and lets Sam cross the bridge safely.\n\nWhich statement best compares how the two stories approach the conflict?",

In Story 1, Sir Leo uses force (\"draws his heavy sword,\" \"charges,\" \"battle\") to remove the dragon. In Story 2, Sam uses kindness (\"offers it a warm meat pie\") to befriend the troll. Option B is incorrect because the texts state that both characters cross safely. Option C is incorrect because Sir Leo uses a sword (not magic), and Sam uses a pie (not a sword).

Coyote knew he was not strong enough to push it, so he decided to use his wits. He painted a frightened face on the Boulder and whispered, \"The river is flooding! It will swallow you whole!\" Then, Coyote splashed water from a cup and mimicked the roar of a flood. Terrified of drowning, the Boulder rolled itself high up the mountain to escape, leaving the path clear for Coyote.\n\n**Story 2: The Ant and the Log**\nA fallen Log blocked the Ant’s path to the colony. The Ant could not trick the Log, for wood does not listen. Instead, the Ant began to chew. He bit off one tiny splinter, then another. The sun set and rose, but the Ant did not stop. After three days of constant work, he had carved a small tunnel through the wood and marched safely home.\n\nHow do the two stories differ in their approach to solving a problem?",
      "answer": "A",
      "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because it accurately identifies and abstracts the method used in each story. In Story 1, Coyote solves the problem by exploiting the Boulder's fear ('manipulating emotions') rather than using force. In Story 2, the Ant solves the problem through physical persistence over three days ('tireless effort'). Option B is incorrect because Story 1 explicitly states Coyote was not strong enough and used wits, while Story 2 involves physical labor, not a clever trick. Option C is incorrect because Coyote succeeds, and the Ant works alone without asking for help. Option D is incorrect because Coyote tricks the Boulder (he does not cooperate with it), and the Ant takes action rather than waiting.",

Halfway up, the trail disappeared under a pile of fallen rocks. Elena took a deep breath and studied the canyon wall. She noticed small footholds in the stone that others had missed. Relying on her own strength and careful observation, she climbed past the blockage and reached the ruins proudly.\n\n**Story 2: The Heavy Cart**\nLiam needed to move a cart filled with pumpkins to the market, but one of the wheels broke in a mud puddle. He tried to lift the cart himself, but it was too heavy. Liam waved to a group of farmers walking by. \"Can you help me?\" he asked.

First, starting later will help students learn better because most kids don’t get enough sleep. A children’s hospital study found that when middle and elementary students sleep at least 9 hours, they pay attention longer and remember more. In a nearby district that moved its start time later last year, average math scores rose by 6 points.\n\nSecond, a later start will make getting to school safer. In October and November, it’s still dark when many students walk or wait at bus stops. Our town’s police report showed that most morning pedestrian near-misses happened before 8:00 a.m., when visibility was low.\n\nFinally, a later start does not have to ruin after-school activities. The district’s schedule proposal shows moving homeroom and shortening passing time by one minute each period keeps dismissal within 10 minutes of the current time.”\n\nWhich option BEST summarizes the speaker’s main points AND explains how each claim is supported by reasons and evidence?",

      "question": "Read the passage from a classroom story: 'Nina mapped the garden plot with labeled zones for each vegetable, measuring spacing with a ruler while muttering, 'Science needs precision.' Beside her, Omar tossed seeds freely into the soil, humming as he arranged sunflowers like 'nature's confetti.' When Nina's rigid rows drowned in heavy rain, Omar's wild patches held firm. Without speaking, Nina used Omar's sunflower stalks as natural trellises for her beans, while he adopted her crop-rotation notes. Their harvest yielded both orderly rows of carrots and unexpected rainbow chard sprouting through the sunflowers.' How do Nina and Omar differ in their gardening approaches, and what does their interaction reveal about how their methods combine?",

Piles of unsold bread grew stale, and unpaid bills were stacking up on the counter. Mrs. Higgins considered closing the shop permanently to save her remaining savings. However, looking at her loyal staff who relied on their paychecks, she knew she couldn't quit. She gathered them together and announced a plan to reduce costs and stay open until the roadwork finished next month. \"It will be tough, but we must **weather the storm**,\" she said.\n\nBased on the passage, which statements best explain the meaning of the phrase **weather the storm**?

Therefore, surviving a difficult period (Option A) and getting through a challenge without quitting (Option C) are the correct interpretations. Option B is incorrect because it interprets \"storm\" literally; there is no mention of actual weather in the passage.

Option D is incorrect because the passage describes \"afternoon heat,\" so the town would not need a blanket for warmth or protection from the cold; this option ignores the negative context of the word \"smothered.\"",

Recent geological analysis reveals that the ancient Romans incorporated specific volcanic ash from the Pozzuoli region into their lime-based mortar. When seawater penetrates the concrete's microcracks, it dissolves the volcanic ash and triggers a chemical reaction that produces new mineral crystals. These minerals, including aluminous tobermorite, actually fill the cracks and strengthen the structure over time. However, Roman concrete required lengthy curing periods of up to two years before reaching full strength, making it impractical for rapid modern construction schedules. Additionally, the Romans relied on extensive manual labor to mix and place the material, as they lacked mechanical mixing equipment. While contemporary engineers admire the durability, they note that the specific volcanic materials necessary for this chemical process are geographically limited and would be difficult to transport globally for widespread modern use.\n\nWhich statements are supported by the passage?

On one hand, beavers create wetlands that provide essential homes for birds, fish, and amphibians. Their dams slow down river currents, which filters pollution and reduces erosion. On the other hand, beaver dams can cause significant flooding that damages farmland and roads. The standing water behind these dams may also kill valuable trees by drowning their roots, creating challenges for the people living nearby.\n\nBased on the passage, which statements represent the main ideas of the text?

To solve this, they introduced cane toads, hoping the toads would eat the beetles and save the harvest. However, the plan was unsuccessful for specific biological reasons. First, the cane beetles lived on the upper stalks of the plants, and the toads could not jump high enough to reach them. Second, the toads were active at night, while the beetles were mostly active during the day, so their paths rarely crossed. Instead of saving the crops, the toads multiplied uncontrollably because they had no natural predators in the new environment.\"\n\nWhich evidence from the text supports the point that the physical and behavioral traits of the cane toad made them unsuitable for catching the beetles?

Mr. Silas struggled to carry heavy buckets alone, and his plants began to wither. Next door, the children formed a bucket brigade, passing water efficiently down the line to save their vegetables. Seeing Mr. Silas slump against his fence, exhausted, a girl named Amara didn't hesitate. She signaled the line to shift, and soon, buckets of water were being poured onto Mr. Silas’s parched soil.

The curtain rises in ten minutes. The play is ruined, and it’s your job to manage the props, Ben!\n\n**BEN:** (Taking a deep breath) Yelling won’t fix the cardboard, Lucas. I know it happened on my watch, but I can’t hold the pieces together and tape them at the same time.\n\n**LUCAS:** (Stops pacing) I guess panic isn't helping, is it? (He steps forward) If I hold the branch steady, can you reach the split?\n\n**BEN:** Exactly. If we combine our efforts, the audience won’t even see the tear.\n\nBased on the drama, which statements best represent the themes of the text? Select all that apply.",

Ben states, 'Yelling won’t fix the cardboard,' and Lucas eventually realizes that 'panic isn't helping,' showing that moving past blame to a solution is the better path. Option B is correct because the conflict is resolved only when the characters collaborate. Ben admits he 'can’t hold the pieces... alone,' and the problem is fixed only when they 'combine our efforts.' Option C is incorrect because the text demonstrates that Lucas's anger and anxiety were wasting time and not helping ('Yelling won't fix the cardboard'). Option D is incorrect because the text specifically illustrates a situation where solving the problem alone was impossible; Ben required Lucas's help to succeed.",

The cafeteria buzzed with noise, making Leo’s hands shake. When the judges arrived, he rushed and poured the vinegar too fast.

They argue about what to do: Sarah wants to find the key, but Ben is impatient. Frustrated, Ben grabs the box and storms out to the shed to pry it open.\n**Scene 2:** A severe storm suddenly strikes the island. In the shed, the wind slams the door shut, locking Ben inside as floodwaters begin to rise. Back in the lighthouse, Sarah realizes Ben is missing and looks out at the storm in fear.\n\nBased on the summaries, which statements best explain how Scene 1 and Scene 2 fit together to provide the drama's structure?

Ten-year-old Sam didn't believe in ghosts. One windy evening, he inspected the alley behind the shop. He discovered a loose shutter banging against the brick wall. Sam tightened the latch, and the \"ghost\" fell silent forever.\n\n**Story 2: The Missing Mascot**\nWhen the school’s tiger costume disappeared, everyone blamed the rival team. Twelve-year-old Elena refused to accept the rumors without proof. She reviewed the gym's security camera footage from the previous day. The video showed the coach accidentally locking the costume in the equipment shed. Elena retrieved it before the big game.\n\nBoth stories belong to the mystery genre.

Option C is correct because Sam finds that the \"ghost\" was just a loose shutter blowing in the wind (a natural cause), whereas Elena discovers the costume was misplaced by the coach (a human error). Option B is incorrect because it swaps the central topics of the stories; \"The Midnight Rattle\" is about the noise, and \"The Missing Mascot\" is about the missing object. Option D is incorrect because neither story involves a villain or intentional wrongdoing; the problems were caused by wind and an accident.",

The rabbit knew he could not win a fight against the strong wolf. Instead, he led the wolf to a hollow log that was very narrow.

Select all that apply.\n\nExcerpt from the speech:\n\"Implementing a school-wide breakfast program would benefit our students in three critical ways. First, it would boost academic achievement. According to a three-year study by the National Student Health Council, schools that provided free morning meals saw standardized test scores improve by an average of 18%, particularly in mathematics. Second, the program would solve our tardiness problem. Last year, Maplewood Middle School started serving breakfast at 7:30 AM, and their attendance records show that late arrivals decreased by 42% within the first semester. Third, eating breakfast at school promotes better nutrition. Our district dietitian reported that students who eat the balanced meals we provide consume 35% fewer high-sugar snacks during the day compared to those who skip breakfast or eat processed foods at home.\"",

Option C correctly matches the nutrition claim with the district dietitian's finding about 35% fewer high-sugar snacks.

      "question": "Read the narrative excerpt below, then choose the sentences that would serve as a logical conclusion that follows from the narrated experiences. Select all that apply.\n\n\"Jun had insisted on building the bluebird house alone, brushing off his grandfather's offers to help measure the cedar planks. For three weekends, he sawed and sanded in the garage, determined to prove he could handle the tools without guidance. But when he assembled the pieces, the roof sat crooked, leaving a gap that would let rain pour onto the nesting shelf. Jun stared at the error, his cheeks burning with the realization that his stubbornness had wasted precious spring days when birds were already searching for homes. Instead of saying 'I told you so,' his grandfather knelt beside him and showed how to use a carpenter's square to check angles—a tool Jun had dismissed as 'old-fashioned.' Together they disassembled the roof, and Jun listened carefully as his grandfather explained how wood grain affects cuts. By sunset, the house stood level and sturdy, and Jun had filled three pages of his notebook with sketches about grain patterns and joinery techniques he never knew existed.\"\n\nWhich of the following sentences could effectively conclude this story?",

Option A demonstrates a practical application of the lesson learned (valuing traditional tools and techniques), consistent with Jun's action of sketching in his notebook and his newfound respect for the carpenter's square. Option C captures the internal realization that mistakes can lead to valuable discoveries about family connection and craft, aligning with the emotional shift from stubborn isolation to collaborative learning. Option B contradicts the text by suggesting Jun completed the project without assistance, when the narrative explicitly describes his grandfather's crucial help with the roof; it also introduces an unsupported external evaluation (teacher's extra credit). Option D represents an overgeneralization that contradicts the story's hopeful tone; while Jun learned to accept help, there is no evidence he lost confidence in all his previous work or became dependent on external validation.",

Look at this heat map from last July's heat wave. The dark red zones show streets with less than 15% tree canopy cover—these areas reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit by noon. Now look at the green zones: streets with 40% or more canopy cover peaked at just 86 degrees, a full 12 degrees cooler despite receiving the same sunlight.\n\nThe bar graph beside me breaks this down by neighborhood. Oakhaven added 200 new trees along Main Street in 2022 and saw a 15% reduction in heat-related emergency calls that summer. Riverside, which focused only on installing reflective pavement without adding trees, saw just a 3-degree temperature drop and no change in emergency calls.\n\nCity planners conclude that increasing tree canopy is the most effective strategy for combating urban heat. Starting next spring, we will expand the program to add 500 trees in the three hottest neighborhoods, prioritizing areas near schools and senior centers.\"\n\nData visualizations:\n• Heat Map: Dark red zones (<15% canopy) = 98°F peak; Green zones (40%+ canopy) = 86°F peak\n• Bar Graph: Oakhaven (200 trees added 2022) = 15% reduction in heat-related emergency calls; Riverside (reflective pavement only) = 3°F drop, no change in emergency calls",

Option B is incorrect because it confuses specific data points from different sources—86 degrees was the green zone temperature, not Oakhaven's specific reading, and it includes excessive numerical details (200 trees, 3 degrees) that are supporting evidence, not summary-level main ideas.

Then, in the blank, write the letter of the sentence that best provides a conclusion related to the information or explanation presented.\n\nParagraph: Beavers are often called ecosystem engineers because their activities reshape landscapes and support diverse communities of plants and animals. By constructing dams across streams, beavers slow water flow and create deep ponds that serve as natural reservoirs, reducing flood risks downstream during heavy rains. These flooded areas also develop into rich wetlands that provide essential breeding grounds for amphibians, nesting sites for waterfowl, and drinking sources for mammals. Furthermore, the standing water behind beaver dams traps sediment and excess nutrients, naturally filtering pollutants and improving overall water quality before it continues downstream.\n\nPossible concluding sentences:\nA. Therefore, beavers function as natural hydrologists, habitat creators, and water quality managers within their ecosystems.\nB. Recently, wildlife biologists have discovered that beaver dams can help store carbon and mitigate climate change effects.\nC. When beavers build dams, they create deep ponds that help reduce flooding during heavy rainstorms.\nD. Beaver dams trap sediment and filter pollutants, which helps improve the quality of water downstream.\nE. Conservation groups should reintroduce beavers to areas where they were previously hunted to extinction.\n\n(Write only the letter of the best concluding sentence.) __________",

A strong concluding statement must tie together the main explanatory points without introducing new information. Option C is incorrect because it merely restates the first supporting detail about flood reduction rather than providing a comprehensive conclusion. Option D is incorrect because it focuses narrowly on only one function (water filtration) while omitting flood control and habitat creation.

According to a district-wide survey of 500 middle school students, 68% reported feeling less pressure to purchase expensive brand-name clothing after the policy change. While average daily attendance increased by 4% in these schools, administrators noted this coincided with stricter attendance enforcement policies district-wide. Additionally, the number of disciplinary referrals for dress code violations dropped by 85%, though some critics argue this simply shifts administrative focus rather than improving student behavior. Most significantly, school counselors documented that 54% fewer students cited clothing-related social anxiety during peer mediation sessions compared to the previous year. However, standardized test scores in reading and mathematics remained statistically unchanged when compared to schools without uniform policies, suggesting that academic performance is unaffected by dress code changes.\"\n\nTask: Which specific piece of evidence does the author use to support the point that uniform policies reduce social anxiety among students regarding clothing comparisons? __________",

      "question": "Read the passage below and answer the question.\n\nBeneath the forest floor lies a hidden network of mycorrhizal fungi that forms symbiotic relationships with tree roots, creating what scientists call the 'wood wide web.' These fungal threads, called hyphae, extend far beyond the reach of individual tree roots, effectively expanding a tree's ability to absorb water and nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen by up to 100 times. In exchange, trees supply the fungi with sugars produced through photosynthesis. This exchange is not merely bilateral; the network connects multiple trees of different species, allowing them to share resources. Research demonstrates that 'mother trees'—large, established specimens—can transfer carbon and nutrients to shaded seedlings struggling to reach sunlight, effectively nurturing the next generation. Furthermore, the network serves as a communication system: when one tree is attacked by insects, it releases chemical signals through the fungal network, prompting neighboring trees to produce defensive compounds before the pests reach them. However, this system depends on undisturbed soil; logging and intensive agriculture disrupt the fungal networks, potentially fragmenting forest resilience. Scientists emphasize that understanding these below-ground connections challenges traditional views of trees as competing individuals, instead revealing forests as cooperative, interconnected communities where the health of one affects the survival of many.\n\nWhich statement best explains how the 'wood wide web' challenges traditional views of forest competition?",
      "answer": "C",

Option C synthesizes these mechanisms to explain the conceptual shift. Option A misrepresents the sugar exchange (trees provide sugars to fungi, not vice versa) and incorrectly suggests sunlight is unnecessary.

The school board had cut the arts program, locking away the instruments and cancelling the spring concert.

Her fingers stumbled through simple chords at first, and only two friends stayed to listen.

According to a recent CDC study, students who participate in school gardening programs eat 40% more vegetables daily than those who don't. Second, it strengthens science skills through hands-on learning. When students test soil pH levels and measure weekly plant growth, they apply mathematical concepts and scientific observation methods directly. Third, the garden builds community connections.

On the day of the competition, he confidently spelled 'serendipity' and 'ephemeral' correctly, but stumbled on 'acquiesce' in the third round, adding an extra 's' before the 'c'. As he took his seat in the audience, he watched the remaining contestants carefully, noticing how they requested language origins and used the definition clues before attempting difficult words—techniques he had previously dismissed as time-wasting. During the break, rather than calling his parents to leave, Marcus approached the pronouncer to ask about the Latin roots of his missed word. He learned it came from 'quiescere,' meaning 'to become quiet,' which helped him understand why the 'c' followed the 's'.

She measured each row with a yardstick, refusing to plant tomatoes until the soil thermometer read exactly sixty degrees. Marcus, meanwhile, arrived with soil already caked under his fingernails, kneeling directly in the dirt to feel for moisture. He scattered seeds by handfuls, humming as he worked, and used his boot heel to mark planting boundaries. When the sky suddenly darkened and rain began pounding the greenhouse roof, Elena scrambled to protect her organized charts under a plastic folder, while Marcus immediately began positioning buckets to catch runoff for later watering. By afternoon, Elena's section featured perfectly aligned sprouts marked with painted stakes, while Marcus's plot overflowed with chaotic clusters of vegetables that had somehow thrived between the weeds.\n\nQuestion: Which statements accurately compare and contrast Elena and Marcus based on specific details from the excerpt?

Option C is correct because when rain begins, Elena focuses on protecting her documentation (charts under plastic folder), while Marcus takes immediate physical action to gather resources (positioning buckets for runoff). Option B is wrong because both characters do adapt to the weather—Elena by protecting her materials and Marcus by collecting water—rather than refusing to change their plans.

These installations capture rainfall that would otherwise flood storm drains, reducing urban runoff pollution significantly. They also combat the heat island effect by cooling surrounding air temperatures through natural plant transpiration processes. Despite these advantages, rooftop gardens impose severe structural burdens on buildings. The saturated soil and mature vegetation collectively weigh several tons per square foot, demanding extensive reinforcement of existing roof supports. Furthermore, maintaining these gardens requires specialized irrigation systems and regular professional care to prevent plant death and water leakage.\n\nStatement:\nThe passage has two main ideas: (1) urban rooftop gardens provide environmental benefits such as reducing runoff and cooling air, and (2) urban rooftop gardens create structural and maintenance challenges for buildings. A key detail that supports ONLY the second main idea is that the saturated soil and mature vegetation __________.",

When researchers experimentally removed ant colonies from selected trees, giraffes and other browsers consumed three times more leaf material within one week compared to ant-protected trees. The ants, in turn, cannot survive without the acacia nectar, as laboratory studies showed 90% mortality after ten days without access to these carbohydrate sources. This contrasts sharply with the relationship between acacia seedlings and the tall savanna grasses growing nearby, which send roots deep to draw from the same water table, causing the young trees to grow 40% slower than those in cleared plots.\"\n\nBased on the specific evidence regarding leaf consumption rates and survival data, and in contrast to the grass relationship, the interaction between the acacia trees and the stinging ants is classified as __________.",

For years, she had performed her grandmother's unpublished verses verbatim, presenting them as her own work. Rather than withdraw, she spent three nights in the library archives, studying the margins of her grandmother's journals where she had noted the scents of her village. Lena composed a new poem that wove those sensory memories with her own experiences of growing up between two languages. The judges recognized the lineage but praised the distinct voice.

Which sentences should be included in the summary? Select all that apply.\n\nPresentation transcript:\n\"Good morning! I'm presenting the results of our city's Cool Streets pilot program. Look at this heat map from last July's heat wave. The dark red zones show streets with less than 15% tree canopy cover—these areas reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit by noon. Now look at the green zones: streets with 40% or more canopy cover peaked at just 86 degrees, a full 12 degrees cooler despite receiving the same sunlight.\n\nThe bar graph beside me breaks this down by neighborhood. Oakhaven added 200 new trees along Main Street in 2022 and saw a 15% reduction in heat-related emergency calls that summer. Riverside, which focused only on installing reflective pavement without adding trees, saw just a 3-degree temperature drop and no change in emergency calls.\n\nCity planners conclude that increasing tree canopy is the most effective strategy for combating urban heat. Starting next spring, we will expand the program to add 500 trees in the three hottest neighborhoods, prioritizing areas near schools and senior centers.\"\n\nData visualizations:\n• Heat Map: Dark red zones (<15% canopy) = 98°F peak; Green zones (40%+ canopy) = 86°F peak\n• Bar Graph: Oakhaven (200 trees added 2022) = 15% reduction in heat-related emergency calls; Riverside (reflective pavement only) = 3°F drop, no change in emergency calls",

Option C captures the key future action and scope (expansion to three neighborhoods with specific priorities), which is essential for a complete summary of the presentation's purpose. Option B is incorrect because it confuses specific data points from different sources—86 degrees was the green zone temperature, not Oakhaven's specific reading, and it includes excessive numerical details (200 trees, 3 degrees) that are supporting evidence, not summary-level main ideas. Option D is incorrect because it misrepresents the findings by claiming the program failed and draws an unsupported conclusion about abandoning pavement improvements, whereas the presentation actually shows trees were more effective, not that pavement was useless.",
