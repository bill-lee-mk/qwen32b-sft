      "answer_explanation": "The context describes effects that were initially hidden ('appeared minor,' 'seemed effortless'), developed gradually ('expanded incrementally,' 'no single amendment had triggered alarm'), and ultimately caused harm ('compliance costs rivaling those of major corporations'). 'Insidious' specifically denotes something that proceeds in a gradual, subtle way but with harmful effects, fitting all contextual clues. 'Salutary' incorrectly suggests beneficial outcomes; 'manifest' contradicts the hidden/subtle progression; 'ephemeral' conflicts with the long-term duration described.",

Faculty leadership characterized the policy not as a fiscal necessity, but as an invidious distinction that codified a hierarchy of value within the university. This maneuver, critics argued, was designed to preserve traditional power structures by penalizing innovation.\"\n\nTo determine the precise meaning of the word \"invidious\" as it is used in the text, follow these steps: First, analyze the context regarding the \"hostility\" and the \"hierarchy of value\" created by the policy. Second, consider the word's etymology (derived from the Latin \"invidiosus,\" meaning \"arousing envy\" or \"envious\"). Third, evaluate how the word functions as a modifier for the noun \"distinction\" to describe the social effect of the policy. Write 'tending to cause discontent,' 'possessing a jealous nature,' or 'incapable of being perceived': __________",
      "answer": "tending to cause discontent",
      "answer_explanation": "To determine the correct meaning of 'invidious' in this context, one must perform a multi-step analysis. First, the context of the passage describes a policy that creates a 'hierarchy of value' and results in 'immediate hostility,' suggesting that the 'distinction' made by the administration is one that generates ill will or resentment. Second, consulting the etymology (Latin 'invidiosus') reveals a connection to 'invidia' (envy or ill will). Third, since the word 'invidious' modifies 'distinction' (an abstract noun representing a policy choice), the meaning must describe the effect of that choice rather than an internal emotion. 'Possessing a jealous nature' is incorrect because a 'distinction' (a non-sentient concept) cannot feel jealousy. 'Incapable of being perceived' is a misinterpretation of the 'vid' (to see) root; while 'invidious' shares this Latin root, the word refers to the figurative act of looking with malice rather than literal visibility as in the word 'invisible.' Therefore, 'tending to cause discontent' is the precise meaning, as it describes a distinction that is unfairly discriminatory and likely to arouse resentment.",

      "question": "Read the following excerpt from a scholarly critique of biographical theory:\n\n'In her seminal critique of traditional biography, Dr. Aris argues that the subject’s character is not a fixed, internal kernel that precedes experience. Rather, she suggests that identity is a fluid byproduct of specific historical pressures and interpersonal negotiations. To Aris, the notion that a person possesses an unchanging nature is a foundational myth that ignores the way external systems dictate the roles individuals play. Thus, she rejects any paradigm that treats human nature as an innate, immutable truth.'\n\nBased on the passage's description of the views Dr. Aris opposes, identify the specific domain-specific paradigm she is rejecting. Write essentialism, existentialism, or empiricism: __________",
      "answer": "essentialism",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is 'essentialism'. To reach this conclusion, the student must perform a multi-step analysis: first, they must identify the specific viewpoint that Dr. Aris is 'rejecting' or 'opposing' based on the text (the idea that human nature is an 'innate, immutable truth' or an 'internal kernel that precedes experience'). Second, the student must apply domain-specific vocabulary knowledge to determine which term matches this definition. 'Essentialism' is the academic term for the belief that things have a set of characteristics (an essence) that make them what they are, and that these characteristics are inherent and fixed. 'Existentialism' is incorrect in this context because it is a philosophical movement that largely aligns with Aris’s own stated view—that 'existence precedes essence' and that identity is created through experience rather than being innate. 'Empiricism' does not apply here as it refers to the theory that all knowledge is derived from sense-experience, which is a broader epistemological stance not specifically focused on the innate versus fluid nature of human character described in the passage.",

The lover of nature is he whose inward and outward senses are still truly adjusted to each other; who has retained the spirit of infancy even into the era of manhood.'

Vostok establishes as her first central thesis that technological discontinuity—moments when machinery renders existing artisanal competencies obsolete—creates acute structural unemployment and wage compression for established workers. However, she complicates this narrative by tracing a second, countervailing pattern throughout the same historical arcs: the reconstitution of expertise, wherein displaced workers gradually repurpose tacit knowledge into adjacent domains, eventually forming novel occupational categories that command premium wages.\n\nVostok meticulously charts how these ideas interact across decades. Initial waves of mechanization generate widespread deskilling and protest, yet Vostok demonstrates that the very devaluation of traditional craft creates pressure for educational innovation, prompting workers to acquire complementary technical literacies that blend old and new knowledge systems. By the third phase of each industrial transition, she identifies a hybridization point where formerly antagonistic skill sets converge into integrated practices—such as when nineteenth-century weavers became textile chemists, or when twentieth-century typographers evolved into interface designers. This developmental trajectory reveals that technological displacement and skill adaptation do not merely alternate in sequence; rather, they function as reciprocal catalysts, each force simultaneously eroding and regenerating the other in a continuous cycle. Vostok concludes that sustainable workforce policy must therefore resist protecting existing jobs and instead facilitate the transitional friction that propels workers through these evolutionary cycles.\n\nObjective summary:\nVostok argues that technological displacement and skill adaptation develop through __________, a dynamic in which each force simultaneously erodes and regenerates the other to create novel occupational categories over time.\n\nWrite your answer on the blank line provided.",

      "question": "Read the following passage: 'The introduction of the high-pressure steam engine did more than simply power factories; it fundamentally restructured the American landscape. By decoupling production from natural water sources, it allowed manufacturing centers to migrate from rural riverbanks to burgeoning urban hubs. This migration, in turn, necessitated a rapid expansion of the labor force, drawing thousands of former agricultural workers into the city's dense industrial grid. In this sequence, the technological innovation served as the primary driver that initiated the large-scale demographic shift.' Based on the sequence of events and the interaction between ideas presented in the text, what term best describes the role of the steam engine in relation to the demographic shift toward urbanization? Write 'catalyst', 'consequence', or 'obstacle': __________",

In an analysis of interacting events, a 'catalyst' is defined as an agent that provokes or speeds up a significant change or action. Because the engine provided the means for manufacturing to move and subsequently forced a change in labor patterns, it fits the definition of a catalyst. The term 'consequence' does not apply here because the steam engine was the cause of the shift, not the result or effect of it. The term 'obstacle' does not apply because the text indicates the engine enabled and 'allowed' the shift to occur rather than hindering it.",

The objections which have been brought against a standing army... may also at last be brought against a standing government. The government itself, which is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.'\n\nBased on how Thoreau refines the meaning of 'expedient' by describing government as a 'mode' that is 'liable to be abused,' what is the best definition of the term in this context? Write the exact phrase from the following choices ('a moral necessity', 'a practical convenience', or 'an absolute requirement'): __________",
      "answer": "a practical convenience",

By defining it further as a 'mode'—a method or way of acting—that is 'liable to be abused,' he suggests that government is only valuable insofar as it serves a useful purpose at the time. This aligns with the definition of 'a practical convenience,' which refers to something that is used because it is advantageous or handy rather than required by principle. Thoreau's statement that governments are often 'inexpedient' reinforces that their value is contingent on utility. 'A moral necessity' and 'an absolute requirement' do not apply here because Thoreau argues that the government is often unnecessary or even a hindrance to the people's will.",

Furthermore, the narrator states that these experiences 'had made her strong,' which identifies the theme of resilience (the ability to recover from or be strengthened by hardship).

      "question": "Read the following passage:\n\nElias stood before the mahogany looking-glass, adjusting the high collar that seemed to choke the very breath of his convictions. To the town, he was the paragon of industry and rectitude, a man whose every public gesture was a testament to the community's rigid moral architecture. Yet, with every button fastened, he felt the internal landscape of his own passions—the wild, unmapped territories of his youth—receding into a grey, indistinguishable fog. His father had called this 'the refinement of character,' but Elias recognized it as the systematic dismantling of the soul. The more he became the monument the public demanded, the less he existed as the man he once was. The applause of the parlor was merely the funeral dirge for his discarded self.\n\nIn this passage, the author develops two central themes: the rigid requirements of social decorum and the erosion of the authentic self. Analyze how these themes interact through the progression of the text's imagery. First, determine how the symbols of the 'high collar' and 'monument' define the protagonist's social role. Second, evaluate how the 'funeral dirge' metaphor in the final sentence resolves the conflict between his public and private identities. Based on this complex account, which term best captures the ultimate interaction between the character's social identity and his authentic soul? Write enrichment, reconciliation, or eradication: __________",
      "answer": "eradication",
      "answer_explanation": "The passage explores the tension between two interacting themes: the stifling nature of societal expectations and the resulting loss of individual identity. The author uses a progression of imagery to show that the development of the public persona ('paragon of industry,' 'monument') directly causes the destruction of the private self. The protagonist explicitly contrasts his father's perception of 'refinement' with his own realization of a 'systematic dismantling of the soul.' The final sentence employs the metaphor of a 'funeral dirge' to characterize the 'applause' of the social circle, signifying that his social success is essentially the death of his 'discarded self.' 'Eradication' is the only correct choice because it aligns with the 'dismantling' and 'funeral' imagery, suggesting that the public identity has completely displaced or destroyed the authentic soul. 'Enrichment' is factually incorrect as the text describes a 'choking' and 'fog-like' recession of the self. 'Reconciliation' is incorrect because the two identities do not find a balance; rather, one is sacrificed for the other.",

In the passage, the protagonist is plunged into a life-or-death struggle without preparatory exposition, which creates immediate suspense and visceral engagement—an aesthetic impact characteristic of this technique. A 'frame narrative' does not apply here because it requires a story-within-a-story structure, where an introductory tale sets the stage for a main narrative. An 'epistolary' structure does not apply here because it requires the story to be told through documents like letters or diary entries, whereas this text uses a direct third-person narrative.",

      "answer": "stream of consciousness",

A frame narrative involves a 'story within a story' structure, which is not present here. In medias res refers to starting a story in the middle of the action; while the passage depicts a specific moment in time, its defining structural characteristic is the internal syntactic flow and cognitive leap between past and present.",

I did not hesitate to let it be known of me, that the white man who expected to succeed in whipping, must also succeed in killing me.'\n\nWhile both authors explore the struggle for agency, they treat the theme of freedom through different lenses.

      "answer": "servitude",
      "answer_explanation": "Both Mark Twain and Frederick Douglass are 19th-century American authors who wrote foundational works exploring the concept of freedom, yet they focus on different forms of constraint. In Passage 1, Twain uses Huck Finn's resistance to 'new clothes' and 'the widow' to symbolize the character's desire for freedom from the stifling expectations of social decorum and middle-class respectability. In Passage 2, Frederick Douglass describes the moment he reclaimed his psychological agency, resolving that even if he remained a 'slave in form,' he was no longer a 'slave in fact.' The 'institutional state' he refers to is that of involuntary servitude, or slavery. 'Enfranchisement' refers to the granting of rights such as voting; while this was a later goal for Douglass, it does not apply here as a state one seeks 'freedom from.' 'Temperance' refers to a different 19th-century social movement regarding alcohol and does not match the thematic focus of the passage.",

The synthesis of these views—social-technical systems theory—posits that technology and society co-evolve.'\n\nDiscussion Transcript:\nJordan: 'The first theory implies that we are essentially at the mercy of whatever tools we invent.'\nTaylor: 'But the second theory says the opposite—that we have all the power to decide what technology becomes.'\nMorgan: 'Jordan and Taylor have identified the core disagreement. However, if we look at the text’s definition of co-evolution within social-technical systems theory, it suggests the relationship is reciprocal rather than one-directional. Based on that, how might we re-evaluate the claim that social media \"forced\" a change in privacy norms?'\n\nBased on the text and transcript, evaluate the participants' use of preparation and evidence. Which speaker most effectively draws on the research to resolve the stated contradiction and stimulate a more nuanced exchange of ideas? Write Jordan, Taylor, or Morgan: __________",
      "answer": "Morgan",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is Morgan. To reach this conclusion, one must perform a multi-step analysis of the participants' contributions relative to the source text. Jordan and Taylor demonstrate basic reading preparation by summarizing the two conflicting frameworks—technological determinism and social constructivism—but their exchange remains a simple binary disagreement. Morgan, however, fulfills the higher-level requirements of CCSS.SL.11-12.1.A by synthesizing these conflicting claims through the use of specific textual evidence: the 'social-technical systems theory.' By explicitly referencing the text's term 'co-evolution,' Morgan resolves the contradiction presented by the other speakers and propels the conversation toward a new, more complex inquiry regarding reciprocal influence. Jordan and Taylor represent basic identification of evidence, while Morgan represents the advanced application and synthesis required at the Grade 11-12 level.",

He went to the woods but still had visitors and went to town often. It's just a performance for his readers.\nTaylor: I disagree. In the chapter 'Solitude,' Thoreau explicitly distinguishes between physical distance and spiritual presence, arguing that 'solitude is not measured by the miles of space that intervene between a man and his fellows.' This suggests his goal wasn't total isolation, but a specific kind of mental independence.\nMorgan: I agree with Taylor.

This suggests that the collective will is only valid when it aligns with individual conscience.\"\n\nJulian: \"But that perspective ignores the social contract. If individual conscience is the ultimate authority, the very concept of a 'collective will' becomes a paradox because there is no mechanism to resolve conflicting moralities without a shared legal standard. You’re essentially advocating for a system that cannot sustain itself.\"\n\nSarah: \"Julian, your argument rests on the premise that legal standards are the sole guarantor of social stability. How would you reconcile that with historical instances of 'just' progress born from 'unjust' law-breaking? Might there be a form of order, as Thoreau suggests, that transcends statutory law?\"\n\nDavid: \"I agree with Sarah’s point about historical progress.

This act of identifying an assumption and asking for a reconciliation of conflicting ideas is the definitive application of probing reasoning. While David provides valuable support by citing the American Civil Rights Movement, his rhetorical move is the provision of evidence to validate a previous claim, which does not constitute the same level of probing reasoning or challenging an interlocutor's premise as Sarah’s contribution.

      "answer_explanation": "In Source 1, the press briefing makes the quantitative claim that the project was completed for 'less than the projected $800 million allocation.' To evaluate the accuracy of this claim, the data from Source 2 must be integrated. The ledger lists the costs as $450 million for tunneling, $300 million for station construction, and $100 million for rolling stock. The sum of these individual expenditures is $850 million (450 + 300 + 100 = 850). Because the actual total of $850 million is greater than the $800 million allocation claimed in the briefing, a discrepancy exists where the data directly opposes the statement. Therefore, the claim is contradicted. 'Corroborated' does not apply here as it would mean the data supported or verified the claim of being under budget.",

First, determine the actual net percentage of runoff reduction from 2018 to 2022 using the quantitative data in Source B. Next, compare this finding to the claim in Source A and the spatial limitations described in Source C. Based on this synthesis and the need for empirical precision in a formal audit, which source provides the most accurate and credible representation of the project's net five-year progress? Write Source A or Source B: __________",
      "answer": "Source B",
      "answer_explanation": "To identify the correct source, the student must apply a multi-step analytical process. First, the student must calculate the net reduction from the data in Source B: the starting runoff in 2018 was 500 tons, and the final runoff in 2022 was 375 tons. This is a total reduction of 125 tons (500 minus 375). To find the percentage, divide 125 by the original 500, which equals 0.25, or a 25% reduction. Second, the student must compare this to the claim in Source A, which states a 40% reduction. This reveals a significant 15-percentage-point discrepancy. Third, the student must integrate Source C, which notes that the southern sector is still 'High Risk,' providing a logical explanation for why the overall reduction is only 25% rather than the 40% claimed in the summary. Finally, evaluating for audit credibility, the student should conclude that Source B is the more accurate source because it provides the raw, empirical data that accounts for annual fluctuations (like the 2020 flood), whereas Source A provides an unsupported, potentially inflated summary claim.",

The final sentence begins with the contrastive transition 'However,' which signals a rebuttal of an opposing view. To maintain logical flow, a rebuttal must be preceded by a counterclaim.

      "answer": "pivotal",
      "answer_explanation": "In formal academic writing, particularly in the discipline of political science, maintaining an objective tone requires precise, non-hyperbolic vocabulary. The word 'pivotal' is a formal adjective meaning of crucial importance in relation to the development or success of something; it provides an objective description of the press's function. Conversely, 'unbeatable' is an informal and hyperbolic term that introduces a subjective, colloquial tone inappropriate for a formal argumentative essay.

      "answer": "sanitary deficiencies",
      "answer_explanation": "To satisfy CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.11-12.1.D, a writer must maintain an objective tone and adhere to the norms of the discipline. The passage establishes a formal, analytical register through the use of terms like 'causal factors,' 'pivotal role,' and 'demographic stability.' The phrase 'sanitary deficiencies' is the correct choice because it is technical, precise, and objective, focusing on measurable standards rather than emotive bias. In contrast, 'wretched circumstances' and 'deplorable conditions' use subjective adjectives ('wretched' and 'deplorable') that function as value judgments. While these terms are sophisticated, they introduce an emotive quality that detracts from the strictly objective tone required in formal academic historical analysis.

      "question": "Read the following excerpt from a draft of an informative essay on scientific paradigms.\n\nParagraph 1: In quantum physics, the 'observer effect' refers to the principle that the act of measurement necessarily alters the state of the system being studied—for instance, the interaction required to observe a subatomic particle inevitably shifts its position or momentum. This discovery dismantled the classical ideal of the researcher as an impartial, non-interfering witness, establishing that the instrument of observation is inextricably linked to the result.\n\nParagraph 2: __________, in the domain of social psychology, researchers have documented the 'Hawthorne Effect,' a phenomenon in which human participants modify their behavior in response to the awareness of being observed. Though the specific mechanisms are distinct—one being physical and the other psychological—both principles underscore the epistemic challenge that the act of scrutiny transforms the object of study.\n\nTo link these two major sections effectively and clarify the conceptual relationship between the physical and social sciences, which transition (Conversely, Analogously, or Consequently) best fills the blank?",
      "answer": "Analogously",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is 'Analogously' because it accurately identifies the relationship between the two paragraphs as a parallel or comparison across different academic disciplines. Paragraph 1 discusses a principle in physics, while Paragraph 2 applies a similar logic (the influence of observation on the subject) to psychology. 'Analogously' creates cohesion by signaling this comparison of complex ideas. 'Consequently' is incorrect because it implies a causal relationship—that the discovery in physics directly resulted in the discovery in psychology—which the text does not support. 'Conversely' is incorrect because it indicates a contrast or opposition, but the passage focuses on the fundamental similarity between the two phenomena in how they both challenge the notion of the independent observer.",

By processing vast datasets of criminal history, these systems promised a \"colorblind\" objectivity that would neutralize the unconscious biases of individual judges. However, recent audits reveal a troubling divergence: because these algorithms are trained on historical data reflecting decades of over-policing in specific communities, they often codify existing systemic disparities under the guise of mathematical neutrality. When a machine predicts future criminality based on past arrests rather than individual circumstances, it risks transforming historical prejudice into a self-fulfilling prophecy.'\n\nIn accordance with Standard W.11-12.2.F, a student is revising this explanatory text to provide a conclusion that goes beyond a basic summary and instead articulates the broader significance or implications of the topic.

Next, the student must evaluate the two choices. The focus on 'failed results' is a simple summary of the discrepancy already established in the text; it states a fact without exploring its broader significance. In contrast, the focus on 'interrogating foundations' identifies a significant implication: that the pursuit of technological 'fairness' may actually hinder judicial reform by distracting from the root cause of bias—the data itself.

He approached each crumbling structure as a data point, laser-scanning foundations and cataloguing decay rates with scientific detachment. The towns were empty, he noted in his field journal—emptiness being merely the absence of occupation, a neutral void waiting for statistical documentation.\n\nWhile mapping the central avenue of the largest ghost town, he encountered Mrs. Vela, an elderly woman who still carried a watering can to the community garden where no vegetables had grown for forty years. \"I'm tending the absence,\" she explained, pressing her palm into the dry soil. \"The garden isn't empty; it's holding space for what was taken.\" Jun watched her trace the outlines of invisible rows, her gestures describing not what was missing but what remained—an active presence sustained by memory.\n\nThat evening, Jun reviewed his 3D models: perfect wireframes of absence, mathematically precise but experientially hollow. He realized his instruments had captured the shape of loss while erasing its substance.\n\n--- Possible Concluding Sentences ---\nA) Jun submitted his digital models to a national geographic database, earning recognition for the most comprehensive archive of desert decay ever created.\n\nB) He understood that cartography had taught him the limits of measurement, and that some geographies exist not in the stones remaining but in the silences between them, held open by those who refuse to let the absent be forgotten.\n\nC) Mrs. Vela revealed she was the last mayor's widow, finally giving Jun the deed to the town which he could now restore to its former glory.\n\nD) Jun decided to stop mapping abandoned places and focus only on living cities where data could be verified by current residents.\n\n--- Your Task ---\nChoose the conclusion that best satisfies the narrative requirement and write its letter on the blank: __________",

However, the researcher discovers a vast, untapped collection of telegram transcripts and internal editorial logs from the Associated Press during the American Civil War (1861–1865).

According to CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.11-12.7, researchers must adjust their inquiry based on their findings to allow for the synthesis of multiple sources and a deep understanding of the subject. In this scenario, the initial question is described as yielding information where 'general overviews of the topic are common' (suggesting the scope is too broad to allow for original insight) and a lack of data in one sub-sector (rural papers). Conversely, the discovery of a 'vast, untapped' specific archive regarding the Associated Press during the Civil War provides the necessary evidence for a 'sustained' and 'sophisticated' synthesis. By narrowing the focus from '19th-century journalism' to the specific activities of the Associated Press during the Civil War, the researcher can utilize the surplus of specific primary source data to move from a shallow survey to a deep, evidence-based investigation.

      "question": "Read the following research scenario:\n\nResearch Task: An analyst is preparing a formal report for the Department of Education evaluating the nationwide efficacy of dual-enrollment programs on college graduation rates.\nSource A: A 2023 longitudinal study by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center that tracked 1.5 million students across all fifty states over six years.\nSource B: A 2024 blog post by a high school counselor describing how three of their students felt more prepared for college after taking a dual-enrollment English course.\nSource C: A marketing pamphlet from a private university encouraging high school students to enroll in their summer credits to 'get ahead of the competition.'\n\nTo maintain an authoritative and objective tone, the analyst must selectively integrate information while assessing source limitations relative to the task and audience. First, evaluate the scope and purpose of each source. Second, determine why Source B, despite being a first-hand account, is insufficient as the primary evidence for a report intended to influence national policy. Source B is limited for this specific task because its small sample size results in a lack of which quality? Write representativeness, clarity, or authenticity: __________",
      "answer": "representativeness",
      "answer_explanation": "According to CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.11-12.8, students must assess source limitations based on the specific task and audience. In this scenario, the task is a nationwide efficacy report. Source A provides a longitudinal study with a massive sample size (1.5 million), making it an authoritative source for making generalizations about a national population. Source B, while providing a clear and authentic personal account, only describes the experiences of three students. In research methodology, this is an anecdotal sample that lacks 'representativeness'—the extent to which a sample accurately reflects the characteristics of the larger population being studied. Because the task is to evaluate nationwide efficacy, a lack of representativeness is the most critical limitation. 'Clarity' refers to the ease of understanding the writing, and 'authenticity' refers to the genuineness of the account; Source B may be both clear and authentic but still fail the requirement for scale and scope.",

This focus on the inherent fallibility of human nature and the spiritual struggle with evil stands in contrast to the optimistic individualism found in the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Write 'Transcendentalism', 'Dark Romanticism', or 'Realism' to identify the literary movement that characterizes Hawthorne's exploration of these themes: __________",

While both Dark Romantics and Transcendentalists (such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau) valued intuition and the individual, they treated the theme of human nature very differently. Transcendentalism focused on the inherent goodness and divine potential of the individual. In contrast, Dark Romanticism explored the 'shadow' side of the human experience, including the persistent presence of sin, the psychological weight of guilt, and the fallibility of individuals. Realism is an incorrect choice because it was a late-19th-century movement that prioritized the objective depiction of everyday life and social conditions over the symbolic and moral explorations found in Hawthorne's 1850 novel.",

      "answer": "A",
      "answer_explanation": "In the first instance, the relative pronoun functions as the subject of the relative clause 'who had compromised the integrity'; the phrase 'the board suspected' is an intervening parenthetical element that does not change the case of the pronoun. Thus, 'who' (subjective case) is correct, and 'whom' is a hypercorrection. In the second instance, 'if the investigator were' is a second conditional expressing a hypothetical or counterfactual situation; formal usage requires the subjunctive mood ('were') for singular subjects in such conditions. In the third instance, while common usage often treats 'data' as a singular mass noun, formal and academic references like The Chicago Manual of Style and Garner’s Modern American Usage maintain that 'data' is plural (the plural of 'datum') and should be paired with a plural verb ('were' instead of 'was') in strictly formal contexts.",

While the data may superficially suggest a simultaneous rise in both, a more rigorous analysis reveals that the surge in innovation was actually precipitated by unrelated technological breakthroughs.

By synthesizing these context clues—the contrast between a superficial appearance and a deceptive intent—it becomes clear that 'specious' describes an argument that appears plausible on the surface but is fundamentally false or misleading.

Despite his disability, he excelled at a school for the blind in Paris, where he learned to read using raised letters. However, the books were heavy and expensive to produce, making them difficult for students to use. In 1824, at age fifteen, Braille developed a system of raised dots that allowed blind people to read quickly and efficiently. His code, based on a military communication system called night writing, used patterns of six dots to represent letters and numbers. Though it faced initial resistance from some educators, Braille's system eventually became the standard reading method for blind people worldwide by the late nineteenth century.\n\nAccording to the passage, what was a disadvantage of the raised-letter books used before Braille's system?",

Then, analyze how the transition in the final sentence from concrete imagery to abstract concepts serves to resolve the passage's central argument. Which of the following best synthesizes this multi-step analysis?\n\nPassage:\nHistory is but a distilled essence of innumerable biographies. To look upon the chronological ledger of empires is to view merely the husks of human aspiration, stripped of the vital, pulsing currents that once animated the actors. We are taught to revere the date and the deed, yet the 'deed' is a hollow vessel until we pour into it the wine of subjective experience. If memory is a sieve, then history is the residue—the coarse sand that remains when the gold of lived sensation has washed away. Yet, we must not mistake the residue for the river. The scholar who seeks the truth of an age in its treaties alone is like the traveler who believes he has known a forest because he has counted its felled timber. True understanding requires a leap from the quantifiable to the qualitative, from the skeletal remains of 'fact' to the spectral presence of the human will that once contested those facts.",
      "answer": "A",

This establishes the author's critique of data-driven historiography as insufficient. In step two, the final sentence moves from 'skeletal' (the dead remains of facts) to 'spectral' (the living, if intangible, will of humans). By juxtaposing these, the author concludes that 'true understanding' requires looking beyond quantifiable records to the qualitative 'human will' that drove events. Option A correctly synthesizes both the metaphorical critique and the rhetorical resolution. Option B misattributes the 'hollow vessel' metaphor to memory rather than the 'deed' (the event). Option C incorrectly identifies the author's tone as celebratory regarding 'distilled essence.' Option D incorrectly suggests the author views the 'coarse sand' (residue) as a virtue of permanence and misinterprets the author's preference for the qualitative over the quantifiable.",

When every historical document becomes instantly accessible, the curator's value shifts from gatekeeping to interpretation—a task requiring not merely access but the cultivated patience to dwell within contradiction. The amateur, armed with search engines, mistakes retrieval for understanding, collecting facts without the friction of context that traditionally shaped scholarly temperament. Yet this accessibility also exposes the artificial boundaries of disciplines, revealing how the archivist's taxonomy often obscures as much as it organizes. The crisis of expertise is not that knowledge has become too widespread, but that the temporal conditions for its maturation—slow reading, sustained argument, the willingness to remain uncertain—have been systematically dismantled by the very technologies that promised to enlighten us.\"\n\nWhich statement best captures the author's central argument about expertise in the digital age?",

      "question": "Read the following passage adapted from a government report on the National Park Service:\n\n'The National Park Service Organic Act of 1916 established a complex mandate: to conserve the scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife therein, while simultaneously providing for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. This dual mission creates an inherent tension. Conservation requires limiting human impact to protect fragile ecosystems from degradation. Conversely, public access necessitates infrastructure—such as roads, visitor centers, and trails—which fundamentally alters the pristine landscape. The success of the National Park Service relies on its ability to navigate these competing priorities, ensuring that public appreciation of the wilderness does not precipitate its destruction.'\n\nWhich statement best identifies two central ideas of the passage and explains how they interact?",

Option B is incorrect because the text does not mention economic viability or prioritize access over conservation. Option C is incorrect because the text acknowledges that 'providing for the enjoyment' is a mandate of the act, rather than calling for a prohibition of recreation.

      "question": "Read the passage and answer the question.\n\nPassage:\nThe mass digitization of archival collections over the past two decades has fundamentally altered the practice of historical research. Once constrained by geography and institutional gatekeeping, scholars and amateur historians alike now access millions of digitized manuscripts, photographs, and government records through online portals. This democratization has diversified the historical profession, enabling marginalized communities to reclaim narratives previously buried in distant vaults and allowing comparative studies across vast datasets that would have required lifetimes of travel to assemble. The digital turn promises a more inclusive historiography, unbound by the physical limitations of rare book rooms.\n\nYet this accessibility extracts a subtle cost. When a centuries-old ledger becomes a high-resolution scan, it sheds its material context—the particular weight of paper, the chemical scent of ink, the spatial logic of how documents were filed and forgotten in attic trunks. Archivists note that researchers interacting solely with screens often miss the tacit knowledge embedded in physical artifacts: the pressure of a pen stroke revealing anger, the water stains mapping flood patterns, the accidental juxtaposition of unrelated papers in a mislabeled box that sparks unexpected connections. The very searchability that liberates research also flattens complexity, reducing rich material worlds to keyword queries and metadata tags.\n\nParadoxically, the proliferation of digital archives has catalyzed a renaissance of physical engagement. As online discovery tools make researchers aware of previously unknown collections, special reading rooms report increased visitation from scholars seeking to verify digital findings against material originals. This symbiosis suggests that digitization and physicality are not successive stages of obsolescence but iterative partners: digital access identifies patterns invisible to the naked eye across dispersed collections, while material examination recovers contextual nuances lost in translation. The result is an emerging historical method where the virtual and the tangible continually inform one another, producing insights neither medium could generate in isolation.\n\nWhich statement best captures how the passage develops its central ideas and explains their interaction?",

      "answer_explanation": "The passage develops two central ideas: (1) digitization democratizes access to historical documents, expanding who can participate in research, and (2) this dematerialization risks losing the contextual knowledge embedded in physical artifacts. The interaction is resolved by demonstrating that digital discovery actually drives increased physical engagement, and the two modes work iteratively to produce richer historical insights than either could alone.

Advocates claim that location-flexibility empowers employees to tailor schedules, leading to higher productivity and job satisfaction. Companies, in turn, have reported lower overhead costs as they reduce office space. Yet the environmental implications of remote work are often overlooked. Fewer daily commutes mean a substantial drop in carbon emissions, and decreased demand for large office buildings can limit urban sprawl. The relationship between corporate policy and environmental sustainability is therefore symbiotic: as businesses adopt remote models for economic reasons, they inadvertently advance ecological goals. Critics worry that remote work weakens team cohesion, but even they acknowledge the immediate environmental gains created by thinning traffic. If firms can find ways to maintain culture through virtual collaboration, the twin benefits of economic efficiency and environmental stewardship may become inseparable.\n\nWhich option best states two central ideas of the passage and explains how they build on each other?",

Scholasticism predicated truth upon the exegesis of canonical texts and the application of Aristotelian logic within a theological framework. Conversely, the emergent scientific method emphasized induction—the derivation of general principles from specific, observable phenomena. This methodological evolution interacted dynamically with the burgeoning print culture; as empirical observations were codified and disseminated, they functioned as a solvent to the consolidated authority of the Church and the university. Consequently, the interaction between new experimental data and traditional textual authority necessitated a redefinition of intellectual legitimacy, moving away from inherited wisdom toward verifiable evidence.'\n\nBased on the passage, how did the development of the scientific method interact with the existing intellectual authority of the time?",

Option A is incorrect because the text describes a shift 'away from' rather than a reinforcement of inherited textual authority.

Vasquez, facing reelection and pressure from commercial developers, endorsed Osei’s concrete barrier proposal and requested emergency legislative funding.\n\nMarcus Chen, the city’s historic preservation officer, initially blocked the permits, arguing that the wall’s foundation would require demolishing the 1880s timber pilings that supported the district’s registered landmark boardwalk. During a technical review in May, however, Chen unearthed archival engineering drawings from 1887 showing that the original pilings had been driven forty feet deeper than modern surveys indicated, suggesting they could be reinforced with carbon-fiber wraps rather than replaced. Osei’s subsequent stress-testing confirmed that Chen’s retrofitting method would actually dissipate storm surge energy more effectively than her original concrete monolith, though the hybrid design would cost forty percent more and take eighteen months longer to implement.\n\nBy August, a statewide budget shortfall forced Vasquez to freeze all capital infrastructure projects unless they secured fifty percent private financing. Faced with the collapse of her original timeline and the new fiscal constraint, Osei partnered with Chen to pitch the hybrid design to the Bayfront Merchants Association, emphasizing that the preserved boardwalk would sustain tourism revenue during construction. The merchants agreed to fund the preservation components in exchange for expedited permitting, but only if Vasquez waived the city’s usual environmental impact fees for the private investment portion.\n\nIn October 2023, Vasquez signed an executive order authorizing the \"Bayfront Resilience Initiative,\" mandating Osei’s storm-surge specifications, Chen’s reinforcement protocols, and a dual-funding structure that required monthly audits by both the preservation office and the merchants’ coalition. In the final arrangement, none of the three primary stakeholders had achieved their initial objectives—immediate construction, absolute preservation, or minimal public expenditure—yet each had fundamentally altered the technical, financial, and temporal parameters available to the others.\n\nWhich statement best explains how the interactions among Dr. Osei, Marcus Chen, and Governor Vasquez develop over the course of the text and determine the final policy outcome?",

Over the next decade, Muir wrote persuasive essays arguing that the region's beauty was a national treasure worth preserving. His writings caught the attention of President Theodore Roosevelt, who invited Muir on a three-day camping trip in 1903. Immersed in the wilderness, Roosevelt grew convinced of the need for federal conservation. Within a year he urged Congress to place millions of acres, including Yosemite's surrounding forests, under federal protection.

      "question": "Read the passage and answer the question.\n\n\"Initially, an algorithm was merely a recipe for calculation: a finite sequence of operations that transformed inputs into outputs, the sort of logical procedure Euclid might have recognized. Early computer scientists used the word to describe sorting routines—quicksort, merge sort—efficient methods for organizing data that remained transparent and auditable. But as machine learning advanced, the term began to migrate. It no longer described just the recipe; it described the chef who never showed his work. When a credit score denies a loan or a feed curates a political reality, we speak of 'the algorithm' not as a procedure but as an agent, an invisible arbiter distributing opportunity and risk. The word has accumulated weight. It now carries the burden of governance without accountability, of decisions that shape lives while remaining unauditable. To call something an algorithm today is to invoke not just mathematics, but power—power disguised as arithmetic.\"\n\nOver the course of the passage, how does the author refine the meaning of the term \"algorithm\"?",

      "question": "Read the excerpt from an argumentative essay on urban development.\n\n(1) At the corner of Mercer and 5th, three acres of Queen Anne’s lace and rusted chain-link separate the financial district from the river. Developers call it a “missing tooth” in the skyline; the mayor’s latest proposal would replace it with a glass tower and underground parking. To the casual eye, the lot is waste—unproductive, unkempt, a tax liability.\n\n(2) Yet this diagnosis mistakes speed for value. Urban ecologists have documented that such “derelict” parcels absorb stormwater at rates exceeding engineered retention basins, preventing millions in flood damage downstream. The soil, compacted by a century of industry, now hosts mycorrhizal networks that sequester carbon more effectively than the manicured lawns of suburban office parks.\n\n(3) Critics argue that these benefits could be engineered more efficiently—green roofs on the proposed tower, permeable pavement, bioswales. They are not wrong; technology can mimic function. But engineered solutions require maintenance budgets that vanish during economic downturns. The weedy lot, meanwhile, maintains itself through succession ecology, resilient precisely because it is unplanned.\n\n(4) This tension between planned efficiency and organic resilience echoes the medieval commons—lands once deemed “wasted” on grazing because they produced no immediate grain, yet which sustained villages through grazing rights that prevented famine during crop failures. The commons were not inefficient; they operated on a temporal scale invisible to quarterly accounting.\n\n(5) When the next hurricane pushes water toward Mercer Street, the glass tower’s pumps will strain against the surge, while the weedy lot will simply drink. The missing tooth is actually a lung, exhaling moisture into the dry air of August, its value accruing not in rent per square foot but in avoided catastrophe. The chain-link fence was never a boundary; it was a frame.\n\nWhich statement best explains how the author’s structural choices make the argument clear, convincing, and engaging?",

By embedding the counterargument in paragraph 3 before offering the historical parallel in paragraph 4, the author builds credibility through intellectual honesty and creates a cumulative case for temporal reframing. This narrative arc allows the central claim about resilient infrastructure to emerge organically from the reader’s revised understanding of the initial scene, rather than being imposed as an abstract assertion, thereby satisfying the criteria of clarity, convincingness, and engagement.",

No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this, would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid. [...] It is far more rational to suppose, that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority.'\n\nFirst, identify the primary logical premise Hamilton uses to define the scope of legislative power. Then, evaluate how he uses the analogy of the 'principal' and the 'deputy' to justify the judiciary's role. Which statement best synthesizes his reasoning for why the courts must have the power of judicial review?",
      "answer": "A",

Therefore, any act exceeding that commission is void. Option B is incorrect because Hamilton explicitly argues that the court is NOT superior to the legislature; rather, the power of the people (the Constitution) is superior to both. Option C is incorrect because Hamilton rejects the claim that the 'legislative body are themselves the constitutional judges of their own powers.' Option D is incorrect because it misidentifies the roles in the analogy; Hamilton identifies the people/Constitution as the 'master' and the branches of government as the 'deputies' or 'servants.'",

      "question": "Read the following concluding passage from Abraham Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address (1865):\n\n'With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.'\n\nHow does Lincoln’s use of parallel structure in this paragraph support his rhetorical purpose?",
      "answer": "B",
      "answer_explanation": "In this passage, Lincoln utilizes parallel structure through a series of prepositional phrases ('With malice toward none; with charity for all...') followed by a series of infinitive phrases ('to finish the work...', 'to bind up the nation's wounds...', 'to care for him...', 'to do all...'). This cumulative rhetorical strategy creates a sense of moral obligation and rhythmic momentum. Choice B is correct because this structure underscores the purpose of the speech: transitioning the nation from the divisiveness of the Civil War toward a collective effort of healing and 'lasting peace.' Choice A is incorrect because the passage explicitly calls for 'charity' and 'peace' rather than continued martial conflict. Choice C is incorrect because the language is rhetorical and moral in tone, not technical or legalistic. Choice D is incorrect because the passage focuses on healing and caring for victims rather than seeking retribution or punishment.",

Julian traced the embossed emblem on the cover, his fingers lingering on the gold leaf. To open it would be to invite a deluge of history he had spent a decade outrunning; to leave it was to remain a ghost in his own life. Outside, the rain hammered against the glass, a rhythmic percussion that filled the silence of the library. Julian stood, walked to the window, and watched the streetlamps blur into amber smudges. He reached for the handle of the sash, then paused, his reflection staring back with an expression that betrayed nothing of his resolve.\"\n\nBased on the passage, which selection of textual evidence most clearly identifies where the narrator leaves the outcome of Julian's dilemma uncertain?",
      "answer": "D",
      "answer_explanation": "Option D is the correct answer because it identifies the precise moment in the text where the narrator explicitly restricts the reader's access to Julian’s final decision. By stating that his expression \"betrayed nothing\" (meaning it revealed nothing) of his \"resolve\" (his firm determination or decision), the text creates a point of definitive interpretive uncertainty regarding his next action. Option A utilizes personification to establish the high stakes and tone of the scene but does not address the uncertainty of Julian's future choice. Option B outlines the binary nature of Julian's internal conflict; while this explains why the choice is difficult, it identifies the conflict itself rather than the evidence that the outcome remains uncertain. Option C describes physical movements that suggest hesitation, but it is the final lack of insight into his 'resolve' in Option D that constitutes the strongest evidence of textual uncertainty.",

The research vessel above was a speck of light against the twilight, and below her stretched the abyssal plain she had spent five years studying. When the university awarded her the coveted Lennox Fellowship, she thought the hardest decision would be which deep-sea vent to explore next. Then the mining corporation offered her twice the fellowship’s sum to share her coordinates and endorse their extraction plans.\n\nFor weeks, Maya balanced grant applications with glossy brochures promising futuristic metals and clean energy. She rehearsed speeches about progress and human need. But on the eve of her decision, she descended again, this time to the vents themselves. Bioluminescent creatures drifted like living constellations, and mineral spires rose like cathedrals. She remembered her advisor’s warning: “These ecosystems vanish once disturbed.”\n\nBack on deck, Maya declined the corporation’s offer. She published her findings, naming each vent after the myths her grandmother had told her. Months later, she accepted a teaching position at a small coastal college, trading the spotlight for classrooms where the sea’s mysteries could be shared, not sold.\n\nWhich statement best analyzes how the passage develops the interacting themes of professional ambition and ethical responsibility?",

      "question": "Read the following passage:\n\nIn the obsidian halls of the Ministry of Consensus, Elias moved with the practiced invisibility of a shadow. His task was the 'rectification' of archives—the systematic removal of any record that suggested the Great Harmonization had been anything less than a voluntary embrace of peace. Today, however, a fragment of parchment escaped the incinerator’s maw: a letter from a father to a daughter, dated 2142, describing the 'bitter taste of forced silence.' As Elias stared at the archaic script, the sterile scent of the Ministry suddenly felt like rot. He looked at the looming viewscreen broadcasting the daily 'Hymn of Unity,' which preached that memory was the enemy of progress. Yet, the weight of the letter in his palm felt more substantial than the entire glass-and-steel edifice of the city. To preserve the letter was to invite chaos into the curated stillness of his life; to destroy it was to complete the erasure of a man he had never met, but whose voice now echoed his own stifled doubts.\n\nWhich statement best analyzes how two central themes of the passage interact to develop a complex account of Elias’s situation?",
      "answer": "B",
      "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because the passage juxtaposes the Ministry’s version of 'stability' (the curated stillness and the Hymn of Unity) with the 'individual memory' contained in the letter. The interaction occurs as the discovery of the letter exposes the 'Great Harmonization' as a product of 'forced silence' rather than a 'voluntary embrace of peace,' thereby framing the city's order as an artificial construct. Option A is incorrect because the 'bitter taste' refers to the silence imposed by the institution, not a danger Elias is trying to prevent. Option C is incorrect because the text suggests Elias's doubts are a valid reaction to the 'rot' he perceives in the Ministry, not an irrational one. Option D is incorrect because the passage uses the 'sterile scent' and 'rot' metaphorically to critique the Ministry, suggesting that the supposedly clean institution is the true source of decay.",

The walls were not merely lined with bookshelves; they were buttressed by them, as though the heavy, leather-bound tomes were the only pillars capable of supporting the immense weight of his unshared knowledge. He offered no acknowledgment when the door groaned on its hinges; his gaze remained anchored to the cryptic marginalia of a seventeenth-century codex, his fingers tracing the indented ink with a tactile reverence.'\n\nIn this passage, how does the author’s choice to introduce Elias through his physical environment impact the development of his character?",

The use of descriptors such as 'sanctuary,' 'unshared knowledge,' and the image of his gaze being 'anchored' to a 'seventeenth-century codex' directly support the characterization of a reclusive individual dedicated to intellectual pursuits.

Option C is incorrect because the passage emphasizes Elias’s intense mental focus and 'tactile reverence' rather than physical or emotional fragility.

The frost on the apple trees glinted like the broken glass he had swept from the kitchen floor the night before—the same glass that had held the wine he raised to toast his brother's return, a return that had ended before midnight when the truth about the inheritance emerged.\n\nBut the reader must not think Marcus regretted the toast. The wine was already chosen, the vintage pressed in the year of their father's death, a death Marcus had orchestrated with nothing more than silence and a withheld letter.

      "question": "Read the following passage:\n\nParagraph 1: The dust. It settles on the vellum like snow on a forgotten grave. A line here, a smudge there—the ink is pale, a ghost of an intention once sharp. Why did I choose the arch? No, it was the cantilever. The weight of it. Gravity is a patient creditor. My hands, once steady enough to map the veins of a leaf, now traitorous and trembling, map only the distance between what was imagined and what remains.\n\nParagraph 2: Thirty years prior, the sun had struck the drafting table at a perfect forty-five-degree angle. I had reached for the T-square with a certainty that bordered on the divine. The plan was simple: a glass atrium that would capture the light and hold it captive. Each calculation was a vow; each stroke of the pen was a step toward a permanence I believed was my birthright. The city would look up, and in that upward glance, find its own aspiration mirrored in steel.\n\nHow does the shift in syntax and structure between the first and second paragraphs contribute to the passage’s aesthetic impact?",
      "answer": "B",
      "answer_explanation": "To answer this question, the reader must first identify the structural shift between the two paragraphs. Paragraph 1 uses fragmented syntax (e.g., 'The dust.', 'The weight of it.') and disjointed transitions to mirror the protagonist's 'dissolution'—both the physical trembling of his hands and the cognitive fragmentation of age. In contrast, Paragraph 2 employs cohesive, complex sentence structures ('Each calculation was a vow...') and a linear narrative to represent his former 'agency' and sense of divine certainty. This transition creates a poignant aesthetic impact by heightening the contrast between his current state and his past self (Option B). Option A is incorrect because the second paragraph is a memory, not a 'renewed' moment of inspiration. Option C is incorrect because the shift highlights a change in the speaker's state of being rather than establishing that the memory itself is 'unreliable.' Option D is incorrect because the passage focuses on the lamentation of loss and the 'traitorous' nature of the body rather than a philosophical 'rejection' of permanence.",

In his view, the absence of wealth was a spiritual fortification, a \"divine shield\" against the corrupting influence of leisure that so tragically afflicted his own social circle. While he sat ensconced in his velvet-lined study, drafting meticulously worded pamphlets on the virtues of a sixteen-hour workday, he often sighed with a heavy heart, lamenting that his own station in life forced him to endure the burden of silken sheets and imported wines. It was a cross he bore with heroic stoicism, for he knew that by consuming the finest vintages, he was effectively protecting the common folk from the temptations of such worldly distractions.'\n\nTo grasp the narrator's point of view, first identify the rhetorical strategy used to describe Mr. Sterling's lifestyle choices. Then, determine how the discrepancy between the narrator’s literal statements and the author’s implied meaning functions. Which analysis best explains this relationship?",
      "answer": "B",

This discrepancy creates a sharp contrast between the literal praise offered by the narrator and the author's implied critique of Mr. Sterling's self-delusion and exploitation of the working class. Option B correctly identifies this use of martyrdom imagery as a satirical device to highlight hypocrisy. Option A fails because it accepts the narrator's irony as sincere.

How fortunate we are to inhabit such a climate, where the very atmosphere reminds us, with every labored gasp, of the grand machinery of our industrial triumph.

However, the author’s intended meaning is critical of this pollution, as evidenced by the inclusion of the phrase 'labored gasp.' This specific detail undercuts the narrator's celebratory tone by pointing to the actual respiratory distress caused by the air quality. Therefore, option A is correct because it identifies the gap between the narrator’s stated praise and the author’s implied critique. Option B is incorrect as the author does not suggest pollution is more beautiful than nature; the 'grey velvet' is an ironic euphemism. Option C is incorrect because the passage does not suggest a lack of innovation, but rather a lack of environmental care. Option D is incorrect because while the author may agree with the 'cynics,' the term itself is used by the narrator as a label for opponents, and the primary irony lies in the health consequences mentioned.",

Production A uses period-appropriate 1692 Puritan costumes and a dimly lit wooden meetinghouse. Production B sets the scene in a modern corporate boardroom with characters wearing business suits under harsh fluorescent lighting.

This staging underscores Miller’s allegorical intent—demonstrating that the “crucible” of societal pressure and moral panic can occur within modern bureaucratic structures, making the warning about authority and conformity feel immediate rather than merely historical.",

      "question": "Read the following excerpts from two foundational 19th-century American works.\n\nExcerpt 1 (from Ralph Waldo Emerson’s \"Self-Reliance\", 1841):\n\"Whoso would be a man, must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.\"\n\nExcerpt 2 (from Henry David Thoreau’s Walden, 1854):\n\"Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.\"\n\nBased on these excerpts, which statement best describes how both authors treat the theme of the individual’s relationship to society?",
      "answer": "A",
      "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because both excerpts explicitly value individual autonomy over social compliance. Emerson uses the term 'nonconformist' and emphasizes the 'integrity of your own mind,' while Thoreau uses the metaphor of the 'different drummer' to justify why an individual might not 'keep pace with his companions.' Option B is incorrect as both authors are associated with Transcendentalism, which often challenged established institutions rather than seeking to preserve them for social order. Option C does not apply because neither excerpt discusses the loss of rational faculties or warns against isolation; rather, they encourage a degree of social detachment. Option D is incorrect because Thoreau specifically questions the 'desperate haste to succeed' in 'enterprises,' suggesting that material success is not the individual's primary duty.",

Both authors employ personification to characterize the relationship between humanity and the natural world. How does Crane’s Naturalist treatment of this theme fundamentally transform the 'occult relation' established in Emerson’s Transcendentalist excerpt?\n\nPassage 1: 'The greatest delight which the fields and woods minister, is the suggestion of an occult relation between man and the vegetable. I am not alone and unacknowledged. They nod to me, and I to them.'\n\nPassage 2: 'When it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as important, and that she feels she would not maim the universe by disposing of him, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, and he hates deeply the fact that there are no bricks and no temples.'",
      "answer": "D",
      "answer_explanation": "In Passage 1, Emerson represents the Transcendentalist view that nature and the human soul are linked by a spiritual 'occult relation,' where nature 'acknowledges' the individual, suggesting a universe of meaning and correspondence. In Passage 2, Crane represents the Naturalist view, which posits that nature is fundamentally indifferent to human existence ('nature does not regard him as important'). Crane’s transformation of the theme is captured in the 'epistemic shift'—the realization that there is no sympathetic structure or mediator in the universe. The metaphor of the 'temple' in Crane’s text represents the human desire for a divine or spiritual structure (like the one Emerson describes), and the 'fact that there are no bricks and no temples' confirms the Naturalist theme that such mediators do not exist. Option A is incorrect because nature in Crane’s text is characterized by indifference, not 'anxiety.' Option B is incorrect because Naturalism views nature as amoral and indifferent, not 'malevolent.' Option C is incorrect because Crane states there are 'no bricks and no temples,' whereas 'abandoned' implies a previously present spiritual structure that Crane’s Naturalism denies.",

It’s the most effective way to address the prompt's focus on rhetorical tradition.\"\n\nSarah: \"I disagree; the shift from the first-person plural 'we' to the third-person 'they' is a more significant rhetorical move for establishing the speech’s purpose.\"\n\nJulian: \"Listen, we’ve been debating this for ten minutes. We have to submit our collaborative outline in fifteen minutes, and we still haven't assigned who is writing which section or how we’re structuring the final slide.\"\n\nMaya: \"Let’s compromise to keep us on schedule. Sarah and Elias, take exactly three minutes to synthesize your points into a single slide on 'Rhetorical Appeals.' Julian, you begin drafting the 'Historical Context' slide since you completed that research. I’ll act as the scribe to compile our final outline.

Option A and B focus on the intellectual content of the debate (cadence and pronoun shifts) but do not address group management.

      "question": "Read the following excerpt from a speech regarding the ethics of 'Digital Consciousness Archiving.'\n\n'Citizens, we stand at the precipice of a technological dawn that promises the curation of the human soul. The proponents of \"Neural Continuity\" argue that by mapping the synaptic pathways of a mind, we achieve a victory over the ultimate silence. They present a premise of preservation: that a copy is a continuation. Yet, we must examine the metaphysical tax of such a transaction. To archive a life is to transform a living process into a static product—a museum exhibit of a storm rather than the storm itself. When we remove the boundary of the \"end,\" we do not extend the value of the experience; we dilute it. A diamond derives its worth from its rarity; a sunset's beauty is tethered to its fleeting descent. By seeking to manufacture an infinite digital sunrise, we do not honor the human spirit—we merely commodify its ghost, trading the profound weight of mortality for the hollow echo of data.'\n\nIn the speech provided, the speaker critiques the 'Neural Continuity' movement. First, identify the speaker’s core premise regarding the relationship between finitude and value. Then, determine how the juxtaposition of 'the storm' and 'the museum' serves to bridge this premise with the speaker’s concluding tone.",
      "answer": "B",
      "answer_explanation": "To answer this question, the student must first identify the speaker's underlying premise of value. The speaker states that a 'diamond derives its worth from its rarity' and a sunset is beautiful because it is 'fleeting.' This establishes a premise based on scarcity/finitude (Step 1). Next, the student must evaluate the rhetorical juxtaposition of the 'storm' and the 'museum.' The speaker describes the archive as a 'museum exhibit of a storm rather than the storm itself,' characterizing the transition from life to data as a shift from a 'living process' to a 'static product.' This reinforces the idea that archiving is reductive and sterile (Step 2). Finally, this bridge leads to the concluding tone of commodification and emptiness ('hollow echo of data'). Option B correctly identifies the premise of scarcity and accurately evaluates how the metaphor reinforces the speaker's critical stance on the reduction of life to data. Option A is incorrect because the speaker argues against endurance as the source of value. Option C focuses on 'complexity,' which is not the stated premise. Option D introduces 'accessibility,' a concept not discussed in the text.",

The writer wants to insert a transition at the beginning of Paragraph 2 to link the major sections and clarify the relationships between the complex ideas.\n\nParagraph 1: The advancement of scientific inquiry necessitates a rigorous adherence to epistemic humility—the conscious acknowledgment that one’s internal model of reality is inherently limited and prone to error. By prioritizing the validation of data over the preservation of ego, researchers cultivate an environment where anomalies are viewed not as failures but as essential catalysts for theoretical revision. This posture of intellectual modesty ensures that the boundaries of human knowledge are expanded through cautious, iterative verification.\n\nParagraph 2: [Transition Sentence]. This lack of metacognitive awareness can lead to the premature declaration of \"breakthroughs\" that crumble under rigorous peer review. While epistemic humility invites a healthy skepticism of one’s own conclusions, this psychological blind spot fosters a deceptive certainty that can derail the scientific process entirely.\n\nWhich sentence, if placed in the blank, uses the most appropriate syntax and transitions to create a cohesive link between the sections while maintaining the logic of the essay?",

The phrase 'the realization of this ideal' employs the demonstrative adjective 'this' to create cohesion by pointing back to the preceding paragraph's core argument. Furthermore, the use of the em-dash to introduce an appositive definition ('a cognitive bias...') clarifies the relationship by framing the bias as the specific barrier to the 'intellectual modesty' described in the text. Option B is incorrect because 'Because' and 'naturally follows' suggest a causal relationship where the bias is a result of the difficulty of the task, rather than an inherent trait that creates the difficulty. Option C is incorrect because the additive transition 'In addition to' fails to signify the adversarial relationship between the ideal and the blind spot. Option D is incorrect because 'therefore' and 'necessary consequence' erroneously frame the Dunning-Kruger effect as a result of failing to practice humility, whereas the passage implies the effect is an underlying psychological cause of such a failure.",

Proponents argue that AI assistance democratizes access to educational support, enabling students with learning differences or limited resources to refine their arguments and overcome language barriers. Critics counter that unchecked reliance on generative AI erodes critical thinking skills, encourages intellectual dishonesty, and creates inequities between students who can afford premium AI tools and those using basic versions. Meanwhile, emerging research suggests that when AI is used as a collaborative brainstorming partner rather than a ghostwriter, students may actually deepen their analytical engagement with complex topics.

Then, based on that analysis, select the revision of sentence 5 that most effectively utilizes the narrative techniques of reflection and pacing to heighten the intensity of the scene's climax.\n\n(1) The crag loomed, a jagged tooth against the bruising purple of the twilight. (2) Julian gripped the frozen granite, his fingers numbing within tattered wool. (3) He recalled his mentor’s warning: 'The mountain does not forgive hesitation.' (4) He looked down at the sheer drop. (5) He felt a momentary pang of regret for leaving the warmth of the coastal village. (6) He took a breath and reached for the next handhold, pulling himself upward toward the obsidian peak.",
      "answer": "A",
      "answer_explanation": "Option A is the correct choice because it best utilizes both reflection and pacing to develop Julian’s character during the climax. First, the original sentence 5 is narratively insufficient because it 'tells' the reader Julian feels regret without exploring the internal logic or depth of that feeling. Option A employs sophisticated reflection by using metaphors—comparing the safety of the village to 'horizontal' life and a 'phantom limb'—to illustrate Julian’s internal struggle between his past and his current ambition. Second, Option A manipulates pacing through syntax: the use of a semicolon followed by a long, complex appositive phrase ('an ache that made...') slows the reader down, forcing a pause that mirrors Julian’s hesitation at the edge of the precipice. Option B uses reflection but the pacing is more linear and the imagery is less developed. Option C relies on a flashback/backstory (the father's warning) rather than a deep reflection on the character's immediate experience. Option D focuses on external description and a rationalization of survival, which does not utilize reflection to deepen the internal character conflict as effectively as the metaphorical analysis in Option A.",

By resequencing sentence 4 to follow sentence 6 (where Elias attempts to manually recalibrate), the writer creates a new sequence: the character sees a problem (5), attempts a physical fix (6), and only then receives the data that his fix is unnecessary because the equipment is already perfect (4). This sequence forces both the character and the reader to eliminate technical error as a last resort, making the final realization in sentence 7—that the theory itself is flawed—much more devastating. Option A creates juxtaposition but lacks the narrative beat of failed action.

But as I crossed the finish line in third place, watching the winner celebrate, the expected crush of failure didn't come.

Option B is incorrect because it shifts the focus to a future task (schoolwork) rather than reflecting on the significance of the narrative experience. Option C is incorrect because it offers a sensory description of the setting, which does not provide insight into the narrator's internal resolution or experience.

Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe,—'That government is best which governs not at all;' and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have... Unjust laws exist: shall we be content to obey them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress them at once? Men generally, under such a government as this, think that they ought to wait until they have persuaded the majority to alter them.\"\n\nExcerpt 2 – Herman Melville, \"Bartleby, the Scrivener\" (1853)\n\"'I would prefer not to,' he replied, and gently disappeared behind the screen... He was always there—first in the morning, continually through the day, and the last at night. What he did there, or how he passed his time, I could not imagine. Sometimes, for want of something better to do... I would lean over my desk, and peep through the small opening in the screen. Sometimes...

There is no statute which expressly authorizes the President to take possession of property as he did here. Nor is there any constitutional provision which, explicitly or implicitly, authorizes such action.

We may well begin by a practical enumeration of the situations in which the President may act. 1. When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum... 2. When the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority... he can only rely upon his own independent powers... 3.

Option B is correct because many formal style guides, including The Chicago Manual of Style, classify \"unique\" as an absolute adjective, meaning it describes a one-of-a-kind state that cannot be modified by adverbs of degree like \"very\" or \"most.\" Option C is incorrect because usage guides resolve the \"less\" versus \"fewer\" issue by recommending \"fewer\" for plural countable nouns (like \"guests\") and \"less\" for mass nouns or singular amounts. Choosing \"less\" for a countable noun is an incorrect application of this rule. Option D is incorrect because \"between\" is a preposition, and objects of prepositions must be in the objective case (\"me,\" not \"I\").

His arguments, polished and gleaming like fool's gold, seemed to offer a definitive solution to the crisis. However, beneath this lustrous exterior lay a fundamental disregard for empirical data, as his premises relied more on the beauty of the phrasing than the integrity of the facts. \n\nUltimately, the speaker’s dialectical strategy prioritized the aesthetic of the delivery over the veracity of the claims. The audience, caught in the shimmer of his rhetoric, failed to see the hollowness until the debate reached its logical conclusion, proving that a polished surface often obscures a vacuous core.\n\nWhich statements accurately analyze the author's use of the word 'specious' within the context of the passage?

However, the ink composition analysis conducted by the Oxford Conservation Laboratory revealed the presence of synthetic polymers not commercially available until 1952, though the sample size was limited to a single fragment from the manuscript's corner. The provenance records tracing ownership before 1987 were destroyed in a warehouse fire, leaving no chain of custody documentation. Dr. Chen acknowledged in her subsequent report that 'without the complete material analysis or provenance verification, we cannot rule out either a sophisticated forgery or an anachronistic restoration of a genuine document.' Meanwhile, literary historian Dr. James Park argued that 'the stylistic parallels to Marlowe's known works are striking, yet stylistic analysis alone cannot establish authenticity given the possibility of skilled imitators.'\"\n\nWhich of the following statements are strongly supported by the excerpt—either explicitly, by valid inference, or by identifying where the text leaves matters uncertain?

With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. — ‘Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.’ — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.'\n\nIn this excerpt, Emerson challenges the traditional value placed on consistency.

Option B is incorrect because Emerson rejects the need for consistency, stating a 'great soul has simply nothing to do' with it, thereby dismissing the need for a cohesive public persona. Option D is incorrect because, while Emerson mentions 'hard words' (meaning firm or uncompromising), he attributes the misunderstanding of figures like Socrates and Galileo to their 'pure and wise' nature, not to a deliberate or strategic use of obscurity to avoid conformity.",

We erect glass towers that pierce the clouds, claiming dominion over gravity itself, yet within these vertical cities we cultivate a peculiar isolation. The elevator, that silent capsule of ascent, removes the chance encounter of the stairwell; the sealed climate within banishes the seasonal reminders that once synchronized urban dwellers with the larger rhythms of nature. What we gain in efficiency we forfeit in serendipity. The modern facade, reflective and impervious, mirrors the sky but refuses to reveal the lives within, creating a democracy of surfaces where interiority becomes a closely guarded secret. Yet I would argue this isolation is not inevitable. Consider the medieval cathedral, which required centuries of collective labor, each generation adding to what they knew they would not see completed. Such architecture demanded patience, a communal virtue we have largely traded for the immediate satisfaction of the prefabricated. To reclaim the city as a human habitat rather than merely a functional machine requires not better materials, but a different temporal imagination—one that values the incomplete, the weathered, and the shared over the pristine, the instantaneous, and the solitary.\"\n\nWhich of the following statements are supported by the passage?

      "question": "Read the passage below, then answer the question that follows.\n\n\"In the wake of widespread adoption of wearable biometric monitors, healthcare systems have embraced continuous data streams as the frontier of preventive medicine. These devices promise to transform medicine from reactive crisis management to predictive intervention, allowing algorithms to detect arrhythmias or glucose spikes before symptoms manifest. Yet beneath this technological optimism lies a structural contradiction: the populations most vulnerable to chronic disease—those in food deserts, shift workers, uninsured laborers—remain least likely to afford subscription-based monitoring or possess the bandwidth to interpret data dashboards. As insurers increasingly reward continuous monitoring with premium discounts, they inadvertently harden the boundary between the quantified and the unquantified, creating a two-tiered system where health visibility becomes a privilege. Furthermore, the granular focus on individual biological metrics diverts institutional attention from collective environmental determinants—pollution exposure, housing stability, working conditions—that drive population-level outcomes. The interaction between these forces produces a paradox: the more precisely medicine can target individual risk factors, the more it obscures the social architectures that generate disease, potentially entrenching health disparities while celebrating technological progress.\"\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately identify two central ideas of the passage and explain how those ideas interact over the course of the text?

Option C is correct because it captures two central ideas—the promise that wearable technology transforms medicine from reactive to predictive care, and the reality that vulnerable populations remain excluded due to cost barriers—and demonstrates how their interaction creates a structural contradiction where preventive benefits accrue selectively, hardening health inequalities. Option B is incorrect because it mistakes supporting details (insurer discounts and algorithmic detection) for central ideas and falsely claims health disparities have been eliminated, contradicting the passage's argument that disparities are entrenched. Option D is incorrect because it misrepresents the interaction as synergistic and complementary, whereas the passage presents the relationship between individual monitoring and social determinants as paradoxical and structurally contradictory.",

Muir, a preservationist, argued that wilderness should remain untouched for its spiritual value.

While Pinchot’s utilitarianism won the reservoir fight, the tension between these two figures gave rise to the dual-track structure of modern American land policy: the National Park Service focuses on preservation, while the Forest Service focuses on sustainable resource use.\n\nWhich statements accurately describe the development and interaction of the ideas presented in the passage?

Initially, her research circulated only in academic journals, attracting little notice outside environmental economics circles. That changed when she met Senator Dahl, whose district had just suffered a record flood attributed to climate change. Dahl saw political leverage in Marquez’s idea and asked her to draft legislation. As they collaborated, Marquez realized the policy needed a rural job-retraining clause to gain bipartisan support, a compromise that broadened the concept. Months into their campaign, an offshore oil rig explosion blanketed coastal wetlands in crude, triggering public outrage. Media coverage reframed the bill from an abstract economic measure into an urgent moral imperative.

      "question": "Read the following passage:\n\n“The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence is often heralded as the final frontier of the 'democratization of craft.' By lowering the barrier to entry, these tools ostensibly invite a broader spectrum of voices into the cultural conversation. However, this populist framing obscures a more corrosive structural shift. Where the human creator operates through a 'teleological' process—moving toward a goal informed by lived experience—the generative model operates through 'probabilistic' synthesis. This is not merely a difference in method; it is a displacement of the 'self' as the locus of meaning. To treat the output of a probability matrix as equivalent to the output of a human consciousness is to commit a category error that devalues the very 'humanity' the tools claim to empower. Thus, the argument for democratization is revealed to be a rhetorical sleight of hand that prioritizes the volume of production over the integrity of the producer.”\n\nThe author organizes the argument by transitioning from a common societal perception of technology to a philosophical critique of its essence.

By starting with the 'democratization' claim (the opposition's frame) and later labeling it a 'rhetorical sleight of hand,' the author effectively redefines and invalidates the opposition's terms to strengthen the critique. Option C is correct because the author uses a conceptual juxtaposition (comparing the purpose-driven 'teleological' nature of humans against the math-driven 'probabilistic' nature of machines). This structural choice clarifies the ethical implications mentioned in the text—the displacement of the 'self'—by contrasting a difficult philosophical concept with a technical one. Option B is incorrect because the passage does not use a causal structure to discuss the physical workforce or empirical economic data; it remains a philosophical argument about meaning. Option D is incorrect because the passage is linear and progressive, not circular; it concludes by arguing that the 'integrity of the producer' is being compromised, which contradicts the idea that the nature of creation remains fundamentally static.",

It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment, and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments. The courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order to keep the latter within the limits assigned to its authority.

      "question": "Read the following excerpt, then answer the question that follows.\n\n\"Jin adjusted the tuning pegs of the guqin, the silk strings humming with a tension that felt older than the wood itself. His grandfather had played this same instrument in the village square before the dam flooded the valley, before the relocation, before the silence. Now Jin stood in a glass-walled conservatory in Shanghai, the city lights flickering like digital fireflies beyond the practice rooms. The traditional repertoire required fingers to move like water over stone, but Jin's compositions bled into electronic ambient tracks that his professors called 'culturally significant fusion' while his mother called 'forgetting your roots.'\n\nWhen the instrument cracked during a humidity spike, Jin faced a choice: restore it using the original hide glue and silk threads, preserving the ancestral voice, or reinforce it with carbon fiber inserts that would allow new ranges of sound but alter its acoustic soul. He chose neither and both, designing a removable bridge that could be swapped between traditional and modified configurations. At his recital, he played the ancient 'Flowing Water' melody through a loop pedal, each repetition adding layers of urban static until the original tune was not lost but translated, not abandoned but expanded. The applause was polite, confused, then sustained. His mother wept in the back row, though Jin could not tell if from grief or recognition.\"\n\nWhich of the following analytical approaches would most fully satisfy the requirements of CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.11-12.2, which calls for determining two or more themes, analyzing their development and interaction, and providing an objective summary?

It also concludes with a concise, objective summary of the plot. Option C is correct because it traces the development of filial duty and cultural authenticity, explaining how these themes coexist and build upon each other to create new meaning through the looped performance, and includes an objective summary of the narrative arc. Option B is incorrect because it focuses on the author's use of sensory imagery and literary craft rather than identifying and analyzing multiple themes; furthermore, it ends with a subjective judgment about cultural decline rather than an objective summary. Option D is incorrect because it reduces the complex text to a single, reductive moral about technology destroying tradition, ignoring the nuanced interaction between themes, and provides a biased summary that mischaracterizes Jin's adaptive restoration as the destruction of the heirloom.",

He remembered the ink-stained fingers of his youth, the radical pamphlets that spoke of equity and the common good. Now, those same fingers adjusted a silk cravat, poised to sign the very decree he once would have set to flame. The ascent had been steep, paved with the quiet compromises that one calls 'pragmatism' until the mirror reflects a stranger.

He had expected the internal upheaval that usually accompanied such returns—the sudden, sharp intake of breath, the stinging prick of nostalgia. Instead, he felt only a profound, clinical detachment. He lingered at the perimeter, his eyes tracing the flaking paint and the strangled ivy that fought for purchase on the stone pillars. It was only upon crossing the threshold that the cold, distant observation of the facade gave way to a rushing tide of fragmented memories and internal doubts, the physical decay of the estate finally merging with the erosion of his own long-held certainties.\n\nBased on the passage, which statements accurately analyze how the author’s structural and characterization choices relate the setting to Elias’s internal development?

Option B is incorrect because the passage is written in third-person limited perspective ('Elias stood', 'He had expected'), not first-person. Option D is incorrect because the narrator is a third-person observer providing insight into Elias's feelings; Elias’s surprise at his own lack of nostalgia does not constitute 'unreliable narration' in the literary sense, nor is the primary purpose of the passage to document physical changes for their own sake.",

Option C is incorrect because the text specifies Hamlet \"clearly spotted\" the eavesdroppers, meaning his shouting is a targeted performance for a real presence, not a loss of contact with reality or clinical insanity.

First, analyze the metaphysical relationship between the observer and the natural world in each text. Then, determine which statements accurately describe how the passages treat the shared theme of the 'Infinite' or the 'Absolute' behind physical reality.\n\nPassage 1 (Ralph Waldo Emerson, *Nature*, 1836):\n'In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life,—no disgrace, no calamity (leaving me my eyes), which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground,—my head bathed by the blithe air and uplifted into infinite space,—all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or parcel of God.'\n\nPassage 2 (Herman Melville, *Moby-Dick*, 1851):\n'All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act, the undoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask.

Option B is correct because it identifies the primary rhetorical and thematic shift between Transcendentalism and Dark Romanticism: Emerson describes the vanishing of 'mean egotism' to become 'part or parcel of God,' a state of passive harmony, whereas Ahab views the underlying reality as a 'wall' and a prison to be attacked ('strike through the mask'). Option C is incorrect because both authors actually posit that there is a 'reason' or 'reasoning thing' behind nature, rather than a lack of order. Option D is incorrect because both texts are quintessential examples of Romantic and Transcendentalist thought, which specifically reject empirical materialism in favor of spiritual and subjective experience.",

I can take on the role of managing our shared document and citations if someone else wants to lead the drafting phase.\"\nSarah: \"It doesn't make a difference to me; I will just do whatever the rest of you decide once you've figured it all out.\"\n\nWhich students demonstrate the behaviors required to promote effective collaborative decision-making and group organization?

Option C is correct because Jordan addresses the requirement to 'establish individual roles as needed' by volunteering to manage the shared document and identifying another role for a peer. Option B does not apply here because Liam specifically argues against setting a plan or schedule, which contradicts the standard's focus on setting clear goals. Option D does not apply here because Sarah’s passivity fails to 'promote civil, democratic discussions and decision-making'; by refusing to participate in the planning process, she does not contribute to the collaborative effort required by the standard.",

Option C is correct because arranging present-day discoveries to trigger sensory flashbacks that reveal hidden generational connections ensures each event builds on the previous revelation; this sequencing variety raises stakes progressively while maintaining psychological coherence through sensory triggers. Option B is incorrect because isolating each generation’s complete history in separate chronological blocks stalls narrative momentum and prevents events from building on one another across time, fragmenting the cause-and-effect chain needed for escalating dread. Option D is incorrect because inserting uplifting subplots disrupts the accumulation of ominous tone; coherence toward a specific dreadful outcome requires sustained atmospheric intensity, which arbitrary tonal shifts undermine.",

Option C is incorrect because Excerpt 1 explicitly criticizes institutional tradition as 'stagnant pools' that 'stifle' the soul, rather than advocating for it as a guide. Option D is incorrect because Excerpt 2 uses natural imagery ('labyrinth of shadows,' 'sunlight') as a psychological metaphor for the human condition rather than making a claim about the literal technological exploitation of the natural world.",

      "question": "Read the following excerpt from James Madison's Federalist No. 10:\n\n'There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects. There are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one, by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same interests. It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be a less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency. The second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise. As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed.'\n\nBased on Madison's delineation of the methods for addressing the 'mischiefs of faction,' which statements accurately evaluate the logic he uses to dismiss the removal of its causes?

Option B is correct because Madison identifies the second method—giving every citizen the same opinions—as 'impracticable.' He reasons that as long as human 'reason... continues fallible' and individuals are 'at liberty' to use it, diverse opinions will inevitably form, making forced uniformity an impossible solution. Option C is incorrect because Madison explicitly rejects this reasoning, stating that destroying liberty is 'worse than the disease.' Option D is incorrect because Madison presents the relationship between liberty and faction as an inherent quality of political life and human nature, rather than a 'systemic error' that can be corrected through standardization.",

C is correct because 'editor-in-chief' is a standard hyphenated compound noun, 'much-needed' follows the rule hyphenating compounds with 'much' before a noun, and both 'thought-provoking' and 'follow-up' are correctly hyphenated as compound modifiers. B is incorrect because adverbs ending in -ly should not be hyphenated to the adjectives they modify ('highly respected,' 'newly elected'); additionally, 'ten minute' should be 'ten-minute' when modifying 'speech.' D is incorrect because compound modifiers appearing before nouns require hyphens: 'nineteenth-century painting,' 'little-known artist,' and 'self-taught artist.'",

The first recycling center in the United States opened in 1896 in New York City. At that time, people separated materials like paper, glass, and metal to be reused. During World War II, recycling became essential because resources were scarce. Citizens collected items such as rubber and tin to support the war effort. Today, recycling helps conserve energy and reduce landfill waste. Despite its benefits, some communities still lack convenient recycling facilities.\n\nAccording to the passage, what was the main reason recycling became essential during World War II?",

Option A pairs definitive claims from the introduction and conclusion that assert certainty rather than ambiguity. Option B pairs a methodological limitation with the explicit acknowledgment, but lacks the internal contradiction that demonstrates the text contains unresolved conflicting evidence.

No longer confined to university laboratories, data collection now spans continents as volunteers catalog bird migrations, monitor water quality, and classify astronomical imagery. This democratization accelerates research timelines and incorporates local knowledge often invisible to academic institutions, generating datasets of unprecedented scope.\n\nYet this same openness introduces profound epistemological vulnerabilities. Without rigorous peer review mechanisms, crowdsourced databases accumulate errors—misidentified species, instrument calibration failures, and confirmation bias in anomaly reporting. Recent studies suggest that unchecked volunteer contributions can propagate systematic inaccuracies faster than traditional gatekeeping models, potentially undermining conservation policies or medical research that rely on these datasets.\n\nParadoxically, the solution to these quality-control failures has emerged from the crowd itself. Experienced participants have developed self-policing protocols, using statistical algorithms to flag outliers and mentor novice contributors. Platform designers now implement reputation systems that weight contributions by historical accuracy, effectively creating distributed peer review networks. Consequently, the tension between accessibility and reliability resolves into a new model of knowledge production: one where the very scale that generates noise also provides the statistical power to identify and filter it, suggesting that openness and rigor are not opposing forces but iterative partners.\n\nWhich statement best captures how the passage develops its central ideas and explains their interaction?",

Superintendent Dr. Amara Okafor authorized the pilot, citing projections that the algorithm could reduce class sizes by automating basic instruction. Marcus Reid, president of the teachers' union, immediately filed a grievance, arguing that the platform's automated feedback loops eroded the improvisational spontaneity essential to secondary pedagogy.\n\nBy January 2020, pilot data revealed a bifurcated outcome: standardized math scores rose by forty percent, yet qualitative surveys indicated that fifteen percent of students experienced heightened anxiety from the system's rigid error-correction protocols. Reid published a technical analysis demonstrating that the AI excelled at procedural drills but consistently failed to model the Socratic questioning necessary for critical thinking. Voss initially dismissed the critique as institutional resistance to innovation; however, after observing three weeks of classroom sessions, she acknowledged that the algorithm's inflexibility created what Reid termed \"affective bottlenecks\" where students disengaged.\n\nDuring closed-door negotiations in March 2020, Voss and Reid co-designed \"Socrates 2.0,\" a bifurcated architecture in which the AI managed foundational skill acquisition while teachers reserved class time for seminar-style discussion. Simultaneously, state budget cuts threatened to eliminate two hundred teaching positions, pressuring Okafor to expand the original AI system to cut personnel costs. Faced with fiscal imperatives and the Voss-Reid proposal, Okafor endorsed the hybrid model as a compromise that preserved seventy-five positions while retaining technological efficiency.\n\nThe Board of Education ratified the plan in June 2020, mandating that no single course utilize the AI for more than forty percent of instructional minutes. In the final agreement, none of the three primary stakeholders had realized their initial objectives, yet each had fundamentally altered the trajectory of the others.\n\nWhich statement best explains how the interactions among Voss, Reid, and Okafor develop over the course of the text and determine the final policy outcome?",

With every decade the term migrates, and with each migration it gathers baggage. It now carries both exhilaration and apprehension: exhilaration because frontiers promise discovery, apprehension because they invite exploitation. A century ago, frontier meant prairies ripe for homesteading; this morning, a venture-capital brochure called the polar ice caps ‘the next energy frontier.’ Whenever the word appears, ask what—or who—stands to be crossed.

At 11:47 a.m. last October, residents watched as the king tide pushed saltwater two blocks inland, turning Main Street into a canal. Yet, less than a year later, the town council voted to reject a proposed seawall in favor of a living shoreline.\n\nWhy did the town trade concrete for cordgrass? First, engineers showed that rigid barriers can actually accelerate erosion downstream. Next, economists calculated that every dollar spent on a living shoreline yields six dollars in avoided flood damage. Finally, biologists explained that the restored marsh will double as a nursery for commercial fish.

The nap is no longer a surrender to gravity and dreams, but a biohack, a strategic investment yielding returns of afternoon alertness. We do not pause; we reload. We do not rest; we recover. And in this alchemical transformation of being into doing, we have achieved a terrible efficiency: the elimination of the useless, the unproductive, the beautifully, defiantly idle.

      "question": "Read the passage.\n\nKai adjusted the microphone on the city-council podium, palms slick against the polished wood. Weeks earlier, he had drafted a proposal to replace the city’s century-old brick library with a glass-walled technology hub—a beacon, he claimed, for the \"next generation of thinkers.\" His internship supervisor hailed the plan as visionary; the mayor’s office promised funding if Kai convinced the council tonight. As the first slide glowed on the projector, Kai felt a weight in his jacket pocket: his grandmother’s weathered journal, discovered only that morning while packing boxes from her attic. Between brittle pages, she had detailed nights spent teaching immigrant neighbors to read inside the same library, calling the building \"the heart that kept our fragmented stories alive.\"\n\nMid-presentation, Kai’s practiced statistics about broadband access began to blur with the echo of her words. Councilwoman Ortiz interrupted. \"Your model removes the reading room entirely. Where would the current patrons go?\" Kai hesitated, glancing at the sketch of the slick atrium. In silence thick enough to slow breath, he flipped to a blank slide and began sketching anew: the original brick façade encasing modern workstations, archival alcoves bordering 3-D printers.\n\nGasps rustled. \"Evolution doesn’t require erasure,\" he said, voice steadier than his hands. The council voted to table the decision for revisions, and Kai left the chamber clutching both the journal and a marker-smudged blueprint, unsure which felt heavier but certain they belonged together.\n\nWhich objective summary best captures the passage’s two central themes and explains how they interact?",

      "question": "Read the excerpt from an unpublished short story.\n\nWhen I first met Mira, she was already singing on the balcony, a melody that seemed older than the bricks. Only later did I learn it was the song her mother hummed on the hospital corridors the night Mira decided never to return home. But I am getting ahead of myself. Before the song, there was the suitcase – brown, battered, clasp barely hanging – arriving at my door with no note except Mira’s name scrawled on the lining.\n\nThree weeks after the suitcase appeared, the warplanes began their rehearsals overhead, and the city responded by turning down its lights. That same evening, Mira lowered her voice enough to tell me why she had come: “I have two departures to make. The second will be quieter.” She never explained further, but each Thursday, just as the dusk siren dipped, she would unpack the suitcase, remove a single object, and place it on the sill. A chipped teacup, a library card, a child’s pair of scarlet shoes—one by one they lined up like witnesses reluctant to testify.\n\nThe last object emerged in late autumn—a letter sealed with a foreign stamp—and that night she burned the suitcase in the courtyard. The flames glinted off the row of objects on the sill as though the witnesses were finally prepared to speak, but of course they remained silent. Only Mira sang, softly now, the melody shrinking until it fit inside the hush between explosions.\n\nNow the city is rebuilding itself, and from the same balcony I can almost hear her refrain echo above the hammers. But maybe that is just the wind, rehearsing departures of its own.\n\nWhich statement best explains how the author’s deliberate disruption of chronology shapes the reader’s understanding of Mira?",

Elena moved through the corridor with the deliberation of one who recognizes that spaces retain the residue of departed lives; the wallpaper, once a vibrant declaration of taste, now hung in desaturated strips, each peel revealing strata of color like geological epochs. She paused at the threshold of the library, where the air itself appeared thickened by the suspension of unspoken sentences, the dust motes swirling in sunbeams like fragments of thoughts abandoned mid-articulation. It was not nostalgia that constricted her breathing—she had outgrown that particular sentiment years ago, recognizing it as a form of self-indulgence—but rather the acute awareness of temporal dislocation, of standing simultaneously in the present moment and in the memory of who she had been when these rooms last contained her. The house did not welcome her return; neither did it reject her. It simply continued its slow entropic decline, indifferent to her witness, and in that indifference, Elena recognized the true measure of her exile.\n*** END EXCERPT ***\n\nWhich interpretation best explains how the author’s depiction of the house’s physical decay contributes to the thematic exploration of Elena’s relationship with her past?",

      "question": "A student is revising the following excerpt from a presentation to the School Board advocating for a later high school start time. The Board must justify the change to parents who are primarily concerned about transportation logistics and impacts on after-school sports and jobs.\n\nDraft excerpt:\n\"Adolescent circadian rhythms undergo phase delay during puberty due to melatonin secretion patterns regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus. When school start times precede biological wake readiness, sleep deprivation triggers decreased hippocampal function, impairing memory consolidation and executive function. Chronobiological studies demonstrate that early start times conflict with innate neuroendocrine programming, resulting in diminished academic performance and increased mental health risks.\"\n\nWhich revision would MOST effectively strengthen the draft for this specific purpose and audience?",

Option A merely simplifies terminology without changing the mismatched scientific focus. Option C adds academic credibility but fails to address the practical justification the Board needs.

By noon, we stepped onto the summit, the fog lifting to reveal miles of sunlit valleys below.\n\nWhich of the following concluding sentences would best follow from and reflect on what was experienced, observed, or resolved in the narrative?",

Yet beneath these headline figures lies a more complex reality: intermittent generation creates demand-supply mismatches that threaten grid stability when weather patterns shift. Engineers now confront a second, less visible crisis—the aging transmission infrastructure, built for centralized coal and nuclear plants, cannot efficiently transport power from remote wind farms and desert solar arrays to coastal cities where demand concentrates. The interaction between these forces produces a paradox: abundant clean energy in one region coexists with rolling blackouts in another, undermining public confidence precisely when electoral support for green transitions is most needed. Rather than viewing infrastructure upgrade and renewable expansion as separate budget lines, analysts argue they must be synchronized, with storage technology serving as the critical bridge between variable supply and rigid demand. Only by recognizing these challenges as mutually reinforcing—each amplifying the other's potential for disruption—can planners avoid a backlash that might derail climate commitments entirely.\"\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately identify two central ideas of the passage and explain how those ideas interact over the course of the text?

City officials, including Mayor Elena Rodriguez, initially dismissed the plan as aesthetically disruptive and fiscally impractical given the municipal budget crisis. Real estate developer Marcus Chen publicly opposed the measure, warning that installation costs would deter commercial investment. The devastating heat wave of July 2022, which caused widespread power failures and emergency room surges, shifted these dynamics: facing constituent outrage, Rodriguez convened a working group where Tanaka revised his proposal to include cool roof incentives for existing buildings—a modification that addressed Chen's concerns about retrofitting costs. When federal infrastructure grants were announced in early 2023, Rodriguez leveraged these funds to support the modified plan, though she successfully mandated that 40% of installation contracts go to local workforce training programs. By late 2023, the adopted 'Green Infrastructure Ordinance' retained Tanaka's core vertical foresting mechanism but incorporated Chen's cost-saving retrofits and Rodriguez's employment mandates, with all parties acknowledging the final policy as a necessary, if imperfect, compromise.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately analyze how specific individuals, ideas, or events interact and develop over the course of the excerpt?

Option C reflects on Ava's personal realization about the contrast between her own pursuit of technical perfection and her grandmother's embrace of vulnerability, redefining legacy as the courage to pass on incomplete work. Option B is incorrect because it describes an action (burning the sketches) that contradicts the narrative's resolved course of events, representing a misconception that the conclusion must follow the initial plan rather than the character's growth. Option D is incorrect because it introduces a new plot direction (premiering a symphony) that violates the resolution's acceptance of intentional incompleteness and imposes a traditional metric of public recognition that the narrative explicitly rejects.",

Advocates argue that allowing employees to work from home expands the talent pool and boosts productivity, as workers can tailor their schedules to peak energy hours.

Yet the same studies note an uptick in reports of burnout, owing to the erosion of boundaries between professional and personal life.

Where the medical establishment seeks to isolate grief into discrete diagnostic categories—complicated grief, prolonged grief disorder, adjustment disorder with depressed mood—the lyric essay insists on the impossibility of such boundaries. To name a feeling is not to contain it but to acknowledge its overflow. When we speak of melancholy, we invoke not merely a chemical imbalance but a particular quality of light, a slowness in the joints, the specific gravity of Sunday afternoons. The precision of clinical language offers the illusion of mastery, yet it strips experience of its texture. The poet's vague specificity—'the blue hour,' 'the unmade bed,' 'the particular silence of a house after guests have departed'—captures what diagnostic codes cannot: the way grief adheres to objects, the way memory contaminates the present tense. In refusing to separate the observer from the observed, literary language preserves the chaos that scientific discourse attempts to resolve.\"\n\nWhich statement best summarizes the author's argument regarding the relationship between language and emotional experience?",

The foreman, a man whose hands bore the grime of three decades in historic preservation, explained that each layer represented a different era's compromise between grandeur and economy. The 1950s acoustic tiles had muffled the hall's natural resonance but saved the ceiling from collapse; the 1970s polyester curtains concealed water damage while introducing chemical off-gassing that now complicated modern conservation. 'Everyone wants authentic,' he noted, wiping dust from a cherub's face, 'but authentic is a moving target. The building you see today survived because someone in 1932 chose steel reinforcement over oak beams, because someone in 1968 prioritized fire codes over velvet drapery. Preservation isn't archaeology; it's a negotiation with every previous decision that kept this place standing.'

      "answer_explanation": "Option A is correct because it replaces the colloquial expressions 'totally wrecked' and 'thinking skills' with precise, discipline-appropriate terminology ('significantly impaired,' 'cognitive function'), which aligns with the formal diction expected in psychological research. Option C is correct because it removes the first-person subjective phrase 'I think' and the vague qualifier 'very bad,' shifting to an evidence-based objective statement; additionally, using 'data indicate' (plural verb) adheres to formal grammatical conventions of the discipline. Option B is incorrect because personal anecdotes introduce narrative subjectivity and first-person perspective, which conflict with the impersonal, evidence-based tone required in scientific writing. Option D is incorrect because rhetorical questions directly address the reader ('you') and employ colloquial phrasing ('feel so stupid,' 'pulling an all-nighter'), creating a conversational tone that undermines the formality of academic research.",

On one side stood epidemiologists who, facing typhoid, polio, tobacco-related illness, and later HIV/AIDS, pressed for swift, science-based interventions to curb mortality rates. On the other side were legislators wary of restricting personal choice and citizens suspicious of government intrusion. Rather than depicting these positions as irreconcilable, Diaz shows how debate, compromise, and reframing gradually turned conflict into momentum. For example, vaccine drives succeeded once policymakers emphasized communal immunity as a precondition for individual opportunity, and anti-smoking ordinances gained traction when framed as protections for workers rather than mandates on consumers. Diaz concludes that the greatest strides in public health have arisen whenever officials, researchers, and the public engaged in what he calls a \"productive dialectic\"—a rigorous back-and-forth in which scientific urgency refines, and is refined by, democratic values.\n\nObjective summary:\nDiaz contends that meaningful public-health progress results from a __________ between scientific urgency and individual liberty, illustrating how these seemingly opposing forces continually shape and strengthen one another.\n\nWrite your answer on the blank line provided.",

In its place would rise a digital banking kiosk, 'strategically positioned for optimal demographic penetration,' according to the developer's prospectus. Elder Chen watched from the relocated community center, a concrete box three kilometers inland where the sea breeze no longer carried the scent of frangipani. The new structure offered air conditioning and ergonomic seating, yet the stories that had been told under the banyan's aerial roots—genealogies traced through touch—found no purchase on the polished linoleum. The efficiency of the modern facility seemed to require the severing of an entire community's connection to its topography.\n\nQuestion:\nThe passage develops two central themes: the imposition of technological efficiency (evident in the 'digital banking kiosk' and 'optimal demographic penetration') and a second theme concerning the violent removal of a community from its ancestral environment and cultural anchors. Identify the single academic term—derived from French and commonly used in postcolonial studies—that names this second theme of being uprooted from one's native place and traditions. This theme interacts with modernization to produce the complex irony that 'progress' often necessitates cultural severance.\n\nThe second theme is __________.",

Dr. Aris explained the disputed translation, her voice adopting the clinical detachment of a coroner reporting findings. Her colleague, Marin, watched the window behind her, where rain blurred the garden into gray abstraction. But Aris did not notice; she __________ the page's curled corner, her palm flattening the fiber that had been thumbed into a permanent wave by decades of scholarly debate. When she reached the contested line—the one that could rewrite the chronology of the dynasty—her hand suddenly clenched, crumpling the edge she had just been tending.\"\n\nWhich single word, if inserted in the blank, would best demonstrate the author's choice to simultaneously characterize Aris's attempt to maintain professional composure through physical ritual and foreshadow her eventual loss of scholarly objectivity through the contrast between her initial delicacy and final violence?",

Then, complete the concluding sentence by writing the specific two-word sociological term that captures the central mechanism described and articulates the broader significance of the findings regarding health disparities.\n\nParagraph:\n\"Public health data reveals that residents of low-income neighborhoods face mortality rates 40% higher than affluent areas, not due to genetic factors or individual choices, but because of concentrated environmental toxins, food deserts, and inadequate primary care facilities. Sociologists note that these populations encounter identical disease burdens as wealthy communities but lack the infrastructure to prevent or treat them effectively. Rather than resulting from personal failings, these disparities emerge from deliberate zoning decisions, funding formulas, and policy exclusions that systematically withhold life-sustaining resources from specific groups.\"\n\nConcluding sentence:\n\"These conditions exemplify __________, wherein social structures and institutions inflict harm by preventing populations from accessing basic human necessities.\"\n\nWrite the exact two-word term on the blank.",

Write only the letter (A, B, C, or D) in the blank.\n\n--- Narrative Excerpt ---\nFor her senior thesis, Elena undertook translating the poetry of Alina Voss, a dissident writer whose work had never left its original language. Voss's central motif—\"the silence between footsteps\"—haunted Elena. She consulted dictionaries, linguists, and native speakers, but every English approximation felt like a betrayal, flattening the political subtext of absence into mere \"pauses\" or \"quiet.\"\n\nDuring a research fellowship in the capital, Elena visited the courtyard where Voss had once read her banned verses. Standing among tourists snapping photos, Elena noticed an elderly woman placing her hand on a particular cobblestone, then removing it—touching, withdrawing, touching, withdrawing—as if the stone's presence only mattered because of the air around it. The woman explained that Voss had written about \"the negative space that holds the weight of what cannot be said.\"\n\nElena abandoned her draft translations. Instead, she compiled a glossary of untranslatable terms, leaving the original words intact, surrounding them with annotations about historical context, loss, and the architecture of silence. When she presented her thesis, the pages were riddled with gaps—intentional blanks where Voss's untranslatable verses sat in their native script, refusing to be colonized by approximation.\n\n--- Possible Concluding Sentences ---\nA) Her professor praised her innovative formatting and nominated her for a prestigious translation award.\n\nB) She understood that some silences are not meant to be filled but rather held open like wounds that keep memory alive, and that her failure to translate was itself the truest translation.\n\nC) Elena decided to abandon her studies and become a photographer, since images require no translation.\n\nD) The elderly woman revealed herself to be Alina Voss, finally providing Elena with the exact English equivalent she had been seeking.\n\n--- Your Task ---\nChoose the conclusion that best satisfies the narrative requirement and write its letter on the blank: __________",

Her findings suggest that agricultural productivity and biodiversity can actually __________ rather than oppose one another, creating systems that are both profitable and sustainable.\"\n\nInstruction: Write the single academic verb beginning with the letter \"h\" that best describes how the author characterizes the interaction between the two central ideas of agricultural productivity and biodiversity.",

Edna's struggle against maternal and marital constraints and the narrator's forced 'rest cure' isolation both illustrate the damaging effects of this gendered division, demonstrating how two texts from the same period treat the similar theme of women's confinement.",

Street trees reduce ambient temperatures by up to ten degrees Fahrenheit through transpiration and shade coverage, significantly lowering cooling costs for surrounding buildings. Additionally, urban canopy cover intercepts stormwater runoff, reducing the burden on drainage systems and preventing pollutants from reaching waterways. These ecosystems also provide habitat for pollinators and birds, supporting biodiversity in built environments.\n\nPossible concluding sentences:\nA. Thus, cities should prioritize expanding tree coverage to simultaneously address climate adaptation, infrastructure resilience, and ecological health.\nB. Therefore, rural deforestation poses the greatest threat to global climate stability.\nC. Consequently, air conditioning manufacturers should develop more efficient cooling units to lower urban energy costs.\nD.

Sentence C proposes an alternative solution (efficient AC units) that ignores the central role of trees established in the paragraph.
