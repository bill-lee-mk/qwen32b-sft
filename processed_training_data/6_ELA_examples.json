The context supports this meaning by noting that local groups began organizing fundraisers and lobbying, which are actions that show increasing approval. The literal meaning, \"being planted\", does not apply here because the passage discusses an abstract proposal for a building, not a physical seed or plant placed in soil.",

Sarah’s preparation had been exhaustive; the aria’s complex measures were etched into her subconscious, yet whenever she sang for an audience, her throat constricted, stifling her voice. Her friend Marcus, however, performed with an uninhibited, infectious zeal, even as he occasionally strayed from the correct pitch. \"Your technical precision is flawless,\" Mr. Evans told Sarah, \"but Marcus possesses the requisite soul.\" On the day of the audition, Sarah stood in the wings, observing Marcus stumble through the chorus but recover with a charisma that ignited the room. When Sarah’s name was called, she closed her eyes, visualizing the solitude of her bedroom to dismantle the constriction in her throat.\n\nFirst, analyze the contrast between Sarah and Marcus's singing styles. Then, based on Mr. Evans's feedback and Sarah's physical reaction, determine which quality she most needs to improve her performance. Write confidence, practice, or talent: __________",
      "answer": "confidence",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is \"confidence.\" The passage describes Sarah’s preparation as \"exhaustive,\" implying she does not need more \"practice.\" Mr. Evans praises her \"technical precision\" as \"flawless,\" indicating she possesses the necessary \"talent\" or skill. The core conflict is her physical anxiety (throat constricted) versus Marcus’s \"uninhibited... zeal.\" By visualizing solitude to overcome this constriction, Sarah is striving for the \"confidence\" to perform freely.",

When sudden floods threatened the village, she used her shell savings to purchase emergency sandbags instead. After the waters receded, she discovered her grandmother’s journals water-damaged and nearly destroyed. Lila spent weeks carefully restoring them, uncovering stories she had previously ignored.

      "answer": "Heritage matters more than possessions",

However, as the deadline loomed, the coding errors compounded, and the mechanical arm refused to calibrate. Admitting defeat felt like failure, but watching the mechanism stall yet again left her no choice. She reached out to Marcus for code review and Sarah for the wiring schematics.

The cash inside was substantial—enough to secure the console he’d coveted for months. Scanning the deserted courtyard, he confirmed his solitude; slipping the find into his pocket would be effortless and untraceable. Yet, as his grip tightened, a discordant memory surfaced: the hollow silence in his house last week after his sister lost her beloved plush rabbit. The crushing weight of her sorrow had filled every room. Liam’s fingers relaxed, the allure of the money dimming against the sharp recollection of that shared grief. With a resigned but steady breath, he turned toward the administrative wing.\n\nFirst, analyze Liam's internal conflict.

      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is empathy. The passage depicts a conflict between Liam's desire for the money and his conscience. While he considers keeping the money (greed) and notes that the act would be 'untraceable' (lack of fear), the specific detail that changes his mind is the memory of the 'hollow silence' and the 'crushing weight' of his sister's sorrow. By connecting his own choice to the painful emotions of another person ('shared grief'), he demonstrates empathy, which drives his final decision. Fear does not apply because the text explicitly states he 'confirmed his solitude,' meaning he did not act out of fear of consequences.

In Episode 1 and Episode 2, Leo demonstrates arrogance and deflects blame (ignoring instructions, blaming the manufacturer). Episode 3 marks the definitive change: his actions—retrieving the manual he previously ignored and restarting the work—show that he has accepted responsibility for the failure, even without stating it explicitly. Episode 4 represents the resolution and the result of this change, but the turning point itself occurs in Episode 3.",

      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is humility. To determine this, the reader must analyze the change in Sam's behavior. In Scene 1, Sam displays arrogance and stubbornness by dismissing preparation and claiming he can 'wing it.' However, the question asks for the trait demonstrated in the resolution (Scene 3). In Scene 3, Sam admits his mistake ('we use your notes') and yields control to Alex ('You should take the lead'), showing he has lowered his pride. This change is best described as humility. Arrogance and stubbornness do not apply here because they describe his initial behavior in Scene 1, which he overcomes. Indifference does not apply here because Sam clearly cares about the outcome, as shown by his distress in Scene 2 and willingness to adjust his strategy in Scene 3.",

Then answer the question below.\n\n**Cast**\nELARA: A student who likes organization.\nJONAH: A student who likes improvisation.\n\n**Scene 1**\n[The school hallway. ELARA holds a clipboard, checking off items. JONAH stands nearby, balancing a paintbrush on his nose.]\n\nELARA: (Tapping the clipboard) Jonah, please focus. We need to grid the wall before we paint. If the proportions are off, the whole mural is ruined.\n\nJONAH: (Laughing) Relax, Elara. It’s art, not math. Let’s just start painting and see where the brush takes us.\n\nELARA: Absolutely not. I can't work without a clear plan. It’s too risky.\n\n**Scene 2**\n[Three hours later. The wall is covered in bright, swirling colors. ELARA has paint on her face and is no longer holding the clipboard.]\n\nELARA: (Stepping back to look at the wall) You know, that accidental splash of yellow really ties the sky together.\n\nJONAH: Told you. Sometimes mistakes are the best part.\n\nELARA: (Smiling) You were right. Forget the grid. Hand me the blue paint; I want to add some clouds right here.\n\n***\n\nBased on Elara's actions and dialogue across both scenes, does her attitude toward the project shift from rigid to flexible or from enthusiastic to bored?

      "answer": "rigid to flexible",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is \"rigid to flexible.\" In Scene 1, Elara displays a rigid attitude by insisting on using a grid and stating she \"can't work without a clear plan.\" By Scene 2, she demonstrates she has become flexible by appreciating an \"accidental splash,\" telling Jonah to \"forget the grid,\" and spontaneously adding clouds. The phrase \"enthusiastic to bored\" does not apply here because Elara actually becomes more engaged and happier (smiling) as the plot resolves, rather than becoming bored.",

Since this passage appears at the start and establishes the setting (a frozen lake) and Liam's goal (reaching the cabin), it acts as the exposition.

      "answer": "shift in perspective",
      "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is \"shift in perspective\". To determine this, the student must analyze the relationship between the two sections. The text describes events happening at the same time: Elena is listening for a signal in Section 1 while Marcus is actively sending it in Section 2. The context clue \"unaware that the canyon walls were bouncing his signal away from Elena's position\" confirms that Marcus's current action is causing what Elena hears in that exact moment. Because the events are simultaneous, the structure is not a \"flashback\" (which would interrupt the plot to return to a past time). Instead, it is a \"shift in perspective\" (or spatial shift) that allows the reader to understand the conflict from two different viewpoints at once.",

This is an auditory element, or sound effect, that the audience hears directly. In contrast, the script only describes the sound in text. 'Camera angles' is incorrect because the description focuses on an auditory experience rather than how the scene was filmed visually. 'Facial expressions' is incorrect because Sam's reaction (spinning around) is a response to the noise, not the technique used to create the startling noise itself.",

      "answer": "D",
      "answer_explanation": "To answer this question, students must first analyze the point of view established in Sentence 1. The phrase 'A good chef' establishes a third-person singular perspective. Sentence 2 maintains this with 'He or she.' However, Sentence 3 shifts inappropriately to the second-person pronoun 'you.' To correct this shift while maintaining consistency, the subject must remain third-person singular. Option D is correct because it replaces 'you' with 'the chef,' which matches the established third-person singular perspective. Option A is incorrect because it changes Sentence 2 to second person, which contradicts the first sentence. Option B is incorrect because 'we' introduces a first-person shift. Option C is incorrect because 'they' is a plural pronoun, which creates an inappropriate number shift with the singular antecedent 'chef.'",

Therefore, it means 'a goal to be reached.' In Passage 2, 'objective' is used as an adjective. The sentence sets up a contrast using the word 'Although': the critic had personal feelings ('disliked the genre'), but she put them aside to focus on factual elements ('quality of the acting'). In this context, 'objective' means 'free from personal bias.' Option B correctly identifies both meanings. Option A does not apply here because a 'speech' is how they communicated, not the objective itself, and 'influenced by strong emotion' is the opposite of the meaning in Passage 2. Option C does not apply here because 'rules' and 'knowledgeable' are unrelated to the context clues provided.

      "question": "Read the passage: 'When Dr. Wang first proposed the \"Silent Classroom\" experiment in 2019, she framed it as a radical solution to digital distraction. Her opening argument relied on the anecdote of a student who failed chemistry after constant texting during lectures. The narrative then expanded with longitudinal data from three schools showing a 22% average grade increase, juxtaposed against testimonials from teachers describing renewed student engagement. Finally, Wang elaborated through a case study of Oakwood Middle School, where the policy sparked unexpected debates about equity when students with speech impairments struggled with the no-talking rule.'

However, a recent expedition revealed a thriving colony of these ferns on a dry, sun-drenched rocky cliffside.\n4.

Sentences 1 and 2 establish an old belief (ferns need damp shade), and Sentence 3 introduces a contrasting fact (ferns growing in dry sun). This contradiction acts as a structural pivot, or turning point, which causes the reevaluation described in Sentence 4 and leads to the final conclusion about resilience in Sentence 5. Option B is incorrect because Sentence 3 introduces a discovery that contradicts the earlier background information, rather than serving as its foundation.

His grandmother picked up the packet and handed him a trowel. \"Gardens need patience, Leo, not just seeds,\" she said gently. Reluctantly, Leo dug small holes and dropped the seeds in, covering them with soil. Every morning, he ran outside, but for a week, nothing happened. He wanted to give up and stop watering them, but his grandmother reminded him to wait. Leo kept watering the patch daily, even when he didn't want to. Two weeks later, green shoots poked through the soil. By the end of summer, tall sunflowers towered over him. Leo smiled, realizing that good things really did take time.\n\nHow does Leo change as the plot moves toward the resolution?",

By the resolution, after he keeps watering daily despite his doubts, he sees the sunflowers and explicitly realizes \"that good things really did take time,\" showing a shift from impatience to understanding the value of patience. Option B does not apply here because although Leo considers giving up, he persists and is happy with the result at the end. Option C does not apply here because the text states that \"Leo dug small holes\" and \"Leo kept watering,\" meaning he did the work himself.

She spent three days strictly controlling every detail, brushing off her partner Marcus whenever he asked to assist with the layout. On the final morning, however, Elena realized she had completely forgotten to add the project title, and the judges were already entering the gym. Frozen by panic, she watched Marcus calmly pull out a set of stencils. \"I can fix this instantly if you hold the board steady,\" he said. Elena looked at her incomplete work, then at Marcus’s confident expression. She swallowed her pride, gripped the edges of the board, and held it firm while he worked. When a judge later praised the professional layout, Elena smiled at Marcus and replied, \"It was a team effort.\"\n\nWhich statement best describes the transformation in Elena’s character from the beginning to the end of the story?",
      "answer": "A",
      "answer_explanation": "A is correct. The passage initially depicts Elena as someone who believes working alone is superior ('convinced that explaining her vision... would just slow her down').

This traces a clear arc from solitary work to valuing partnership. Option B is incorrect; while she panicked about the missing title, she did not express doubt about the quality of the work she had already done. Option C is incorrect because Elena actively participated in the solution by holding the board steady; she did not become passive.

Her grandmother, watching from the porch, called out, \"They need time, Maya, not a flood.\" Maya sighed but poured more water anyway, convinced that more effort meant faster results. A week passed, and the soil remained bare and muddy. Frustrated, Maya threw her gardening gloves on the grass. \"I give up,\" she declared. Her grandmother smiled gently and said, \"Nature works at its own pace. Sometimes doing less is doing more.\" Maya stopped to think about those words.

The passage begins by using personification and similes to describe the tree as a 'sentinel' with 'protective arms,' words that connote safety, strength, and guardianship. This establishes a tone of respectful admiration for the tree's role. The tone shifts when the developer arrives; he views the tree as a 'nuisance,' a word with negative connotations implying it is merely an annoyance to be removed. This creates a tone of cold practicality. Option B is incorrect because 'sentinel' implies protection rather than something to fear or suspect.

Option B is incorrect because Text 2 does not punish the fearful; the reed bows (which could look like fear) but survives, while the brave stalks die. Option C is incorrect because the age of the characters is not the primary factor in their survival; the \"ancient\" oak survives, but the \"young\" reed also survives, making the comparison invalid.

      "question": "Read the two texts below.\n\nText 1 (Poem):\nThe oak tree stands with branches bare,\nAgainst the biting, frigid air.\nThough leaves are gone and skies are gray,\nIt waits with patience for the day\nWhen sun will warm the frozen earth,\nAnd bring the green of spring to birth.\n\nText 2 (Story):\nFrom the window, I watched a squirrel digging in the snow. It had spent all autumn burying nuts. Even though the wind howled, the squirrel did not stop working. It seemed to know that food was hidden beneath the white blanket. It just had to keep digging to survive until spring arrived.\n\nHow do both the poem and the story approach the topic of winter?",
      "answer": "B",
      "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct because both texts depict nature enduring the challenges of winter with a focus on survival and the coming spring. The poem describes a tree that 'waits with patience' for spring, and the story describes a squirrel that 'did not stop working' and showed determination to find food. Option A does not apply here because neither the tree nor the squirrel is defeated; both persist through the cold. Option C does not apply here because it reverses the subjects: the poem is about a tree, and the story is about an animal (a squirrel). Option D does not apply here because neither text describes winter as a time for celebration or play; both describe it as a challenging time requiring endurance.",

      "question": "Read Mia's presentation draft about school start times. Then answer the question.\n\n1. Scientific research shows that teenagers’ internal clocks naturally shift, making it difficult for them to fall asleep before 11:00 PM.\n2. Despite this biological shift, many schools still begin classes at 7:30 AM.\n3. Consequently, students sit in first-period algebra or history while their brains are still in sleep mode.\n4. My friend stayed up late gaming last night, which proves that students are tired because they have poor time management.\n5. Shifting the school start time to 9:00 AM would align with adolescent biology and allow students to demonstrate their true academic potential.\n\nMia wants to revise the presentation to ensure that all evidence and details logically support the main theme of biological necessity. Which revision best addresses a flaw in the draft's reasoning?",
      "answer": "B",
      "answer_explanation": "Option B is correct. The standard SL.6.4 requires presenting claims and findings with logical sequencing and pertinent facts that accentuate the main theme. The main theme of Mia's draft is the “biological necessity” of later start times (supported by Sentences 1, 2, 3, and 5). Sentence 4 introduces a logical fallacy (hasty generalization) and contradicts the main claim by attributing tiredness to “poor time management” rather than biology. Replacing this sentence with pertinent scientific data about melatonin (Option B) eliminates the contradiction and strengthens the logical flow of the argument.\n\nOption A is incorrect. While varying sentence order can affect impact, Sentence 5 acts as a logical conclusion to the argument. Moving it does not correct the logical inconsistency found in Sentence 4.\n\nOption C is incorrect. Sentence 3 provides a pertinent description of the consequences of the problem, helping the audience visualize the issue. Removing it would weaken the presentation's detail.\n\nOption D is incorrect. Changing Sentence 1 to focus on social habits would shift the topic away from the established theme of biological necessity, creating a new logical disconnect with the rest of the draft.",

Restrictive elements should NOT be set off with punctuation.\n\nOption B is correct. 'The other guide' clearly identifies the specific person (the second of the two guides). The phrase 'a retired soldier' adds extra information but does not change the identity of the subject, making it nonrestrictive. Dashes are correctly used on both sides to set it off.\n\nOption C is incorrect. Because there is only one medic, the phrase 'carrying the heavy kit' is nonrestrictive (extra information). Nonrestrictive elements in the middle of a sentence must be set off with punctuation on BOTH sides. This option includes a comma before the phrase but is missing the comma after 'kit.'\n\nOption D is incorrect.

The sentence would still make sense and keep its core meaning without this phrase. Therefore, the phrase must be separated from the rest of the sentence with punctuation on both sides. Option A is correct because it uses a pair of commas to enclose the phrase. Option B is correct because parentheses are also an acceptable way to set off parenthetical information. Option C is incorrect because it is missing the punctuation before the phrase begins. Option D is incorrect because it places a comma before the phrase but fails to place the necessary closing comma after 'Japan.'",

Then answer the question.\n\nPassage:\n\"When the astronomer Maria Mitchell accepted a professorship at Vassar College in 1865, she did more than teach constellations; she disrupted expectations. In an era when most universities barred women from laboratories, Mitchell insisted her students take nightly shifts at the college’s newly built observatory. Records show that these young women measured the positions of Venus with an accuracy rivaling that of professional observatories in Europe. Mitchell also campaigned for equal pay, refusing to accept a salary lower than that of male professors in comparable fields. Her protest succeeded only after she threatened to resign, a tactic considered radical at the time. Yet behind her defiance was meticulous scholarship: she published detailed observations on sunspots, linking their frequency to Earth’s auroras. By the time she retired, five of her former pupils were heading observatories themselves—a quiet but measurable constellation of change.\"\n\nWhich statements are supported by the passage?

Instead of spreading crops across vast fields, vertical farms stack plants in layers, often inside tall buildings. This structure allows farmers to control the environment precisely using LED lights. Consequently, a single indoor acre can produce as much food as ten outdoor acres. Furthermore, because crops grow indoors, they remain safe from severe weather and pests, eliminating the need for harmful pesticides.\n\nBased on the passage, how does the author elaborate on the benefits of vertical farming?

Option C is correct because the chart shows Summer wind speeds at 8:00 AM (5 mph) and 8:00 PM (6 mph) are both below the 9 mph minimum required to generate power. Option B is incorrect because the highest recorded speed in Winter is 22 mph, which is well below the 55 mph safety limit mentioned in the text.

She peeked through the gap in the fabric and saw rows of expectant faces. Her stomach did a flip-flop, and her knees felt like jelly. \"You know your lines,\" she whispered to herself. The stage manager signaled two minutes. Maya took a deep breath, trying to steady her racing heart.

      "answer_explanation": "B is correct because the text uses the figurative phrases \"stomach did a flip-flop\" and \"knees felt like jelly\" to describe physical sensations associated with nervousness. D is correct because Maya's need to take a deep breath to \"steady her racing heart\" is a direct physiological sign of anxiety. A does not apply here because the noise in the auditorium describes the setting and the audience, not Maya's internal feelings. C does not apply here because the stage manager's signal is a factual event regarding time, not a description of Maya's emotions.",

Option B is a theme because the guests' positive reaction to the cake and indifference to the cookies demonstrate that people value care and quality. Options C and D do not apply here because they are plot summaries describing specific characters and events, rather than the broader messages or lessons of the story.",

Yes!\n\nMAYA: (pausing, watching the robot) Wait. Did it actually just do that?\n\nLEO: Yeah. It works. I stayed up all night calibrating the sensors.\n\nMAYA: (sets down the baking soda) That’s... actually incredible. I was so worried about failing that I didn't see how good your idea was.

Furthermore, she explicitly states her internal realization in Scene 2 ('I was so worried about failing that I didn't see how good your idea was'), which confirms Option C. Option B does not apply here because Maya sets down her baking soda and offers to help Leo, showing she is no longer stubborn about the volcano.

It showed his father at Leo's age, grinning next to this same bike, hands covered in grease. Leo took a deep breath, picked up the wrench again, and realized he had been forcing the bolt the wrong way.

He pictured the sharp notes as mountain peaks to climb and the smooth sections as flowing rivers. As he focused on the music rather than the crowd, his heart rate slowed, and his trembling fingers steadied against the bow.\n\nParagraph 3: The stage manager tapped his shoulder, whispering, \"You're up, Leo.\" Leo nodded, stepped into the spotlight, and let the first note ring out—clear, strong, and true.\n\nHow does Paragraph 2 contribute to the development of the passage?

It had stared at me from the mantelpiece for years, mocking my inability to play catch in the house without causing a disaster. Mom always called it a 'priceless heirloom,' but surely she meant 'priceless' as in 'worth nothing.' When I heard the garage door rumble open, my heart hammered against my ribs like a trapped bird. I wasn't scared, exactly—just... alert. I practiced my innocent smile in the hallway mirror. 'Hi, Mom! Great day, isn't it?' I whispered. It sounded fake. Even I didn't believe me.\"\n\nHow does the author develop the narrator's point of view regarding the accident? Select **two** correct answers.",

Option C is correct because the author contrasts the narrator's explicit statement ('I wasn't scared') with a physical description of anxiety ('heart hammered against my ribs'), revealing the narrator's true emotional state through this discrepancy. Option A is incorrect because the passage is written in the first-person ('I'), not the third-person. Option D is incorrect because the mother does not speak in the passage; the dialogue is the narrator practicing. Option E is incorrect because the author does not provide a history of the vase, only the narrator's opinion of it.",

Option B does not apply here because both texts explicitly mention the difficulty and time involved, contradicting the idea that it is quick or easy. Option D does not apply here because neither text focuses on specific tools; the story mentions digging without naming a tool, and the poem mentions using 'hands.'",

She wrapped frostbitten limbs in clean bandages, whispering, 'You are not forgotten.' Outside, the wind howled like a wounded beast, but inside her makeshift hospital, hope flickered like a stubborn candle.'\n\nExcerpt 2 (Fantasy):\n'In the Everfrost Realm, the Iceweaver Queen strode across glaciers, her staff striking the ground to summon healing auroras. 'Pain is but ice to be melted,' she declared, as spectral lights dissolved frostbite from her warriors' skin. The blizzard bowed to her will, parting like a curtain before royalty.'\n\nBoth texts explore compassion during extreme cold, yet differ fundamentally in how genre shapes their thematic approach.

A 2023 National Wildlife Federation study tracking 50 metropolitan areas proved cities with connected green spaces saw 30% higher survival rates for native species. While some claim urban development inherently destroys habitats, evidence shows thoughtful planning can reverse this trend—Chicago's 'Wildways' initiative increased pollinator populations by 45% in three years. Critics argue green corridors distract from climate change efforts, but this ignores that habitat fragmentation is the second-leading cause of extinction after carbon emissions, per UN Biodiversity Reports. Most dangerously, opponents suggest wildlife corridors increase human-wildlife conflicts, yet data from the Urban Ecology Institute demonstrates such conflicts decreased by 22% in corridors with proper signage and education.'\n\nWhich claim in the passage is NOT supported by evidence?",

A painted portrait could demand a dozen sittings and weeks of drying time; the new ‘sun-pictures,’ though still fussy, promised a likeness in a single afternoon. Local painter Elias Grant scoffed that no metal plate could rival the depth of oil paint. Yet the longer the line at the studio grew, the more Grant’s laughter wavered. Before the year ended, he began offering a novel service: customers could bring their small, silvery photographs to his shop, where he would add delicate watercolor tints and mount the images in ornate frames. Critics called Grant a traitor to his own art, but he preferred the term survivor. He later wrote, ‘The camera forced me to trade my brushes for smaller brushes—and occasionally for pliers—but it never erased my craft.’ Indeed, census records reveal that portrait painters did not vanish after photography arrived; instead, many re-imagined themselves as colorists, retouchers, or mixed-media artists, weaving old skills into the new technology.\"\n\nQuestion: Which statements are best supported by the passage?

I was ten, impatient, eager to win. But as the afternoons turned into months, I began to notice the pattern in his advice. When I lost my first tournament, I didn't slam the board shut as I once would have. Instead, I studied the game, seeing the traps I had missed. The chessboard became a mirror, reflecting not just my strategy, but my character. Years later, when facing difficult decisions, I still hear his voice: 'Look ahead. Breathe.

Mr. Okonkwo ran his palm along the edge of the unfinished bookshelf, frowning at a barely visible warp in the grain. 'Wood has memory,' he told his granddaughter Amara, who sat on a stool nearby, sketching in her notebook. 'It remembers every storm, every drought. Our job is not to force it straight, but to listen to what shape it wants to take.'\n\nAmara set down her pencil. 'Like when you let me choose my own projects?'\n\nMr. Okonkwo smiled, the lines around his eyes deepening. 'Exactly like that.' He selected a chisel with a worn wooden handle, its blade catching the afternoon light. 'Some would sand this down until it looks perfect. But perfect is often weak. The knots and curves—that's where the strength hides.'\n\nAmara nodded slowly, looking from the wood to her own sketch—a design for a birdhouse that curved in unusual angles rather than straight lines.

Option B is incorrect because Mr. Okonkwo frowns at the wood's warp, not at Amara's sketch, and he smiles during their conversation; this distractor tests whether students confuse the object of the character's attention.

Base your answer solely on textual details, not personal opinions or judgments.\n\nPassage: For years, Aisha deleted any photograph that contained blur, shadows, or imperfections, maintaining a portfolio of technically flawless images that won competitions but drew no emotional response from viewers. While documenting a protest movement, her professional camera malfunctioned, forcing her to use a disposable camera with fixed settings she could not control. The resulting images—grainy, overexposed, and candid—captured raw human emotion that her perfect shots never conveyed. When these imperfect photos were published and moved thousands to action, Aisha understood that her pursuit of technical perfection had blinded her to authentic human connection.\n\nThe central theme conveyed through Aisha's experience is __________",
      "answer": "Authentic emotion surpasses technical perfection",
      "answer_explanation": "The answer is correct because it synthesizes four specific textual details to extract the universal message: Aisha's initial habit of deleting imperfect photos (obsession with technical perfection), her forced use of a disposable camera producing uncontrollable results (constraint leading to new method), the powerful emotional impact of these imperfect images on viewers (authentic resonance), and her final realization that pursuing perfection had 'blinded her to authentic human connection' (the lesson). Together, these plot elements demonstrate that genuine emotional truth holds greater artistic and human value than flawless technique, requiring students to combine evidence from the beginning, middle, and end of the narrative without adding personal judgment.",

Some districts have seen increased transportation costs of over $200,000 annually.\n\n__________, implementing later school start times requires weighing measurable academic and health benefits against significant practical and financial obstacles.\n\nTransition list: Therefore, Nevertheless, Overall, Consequently",
